\chapter{Introduction}\label{S:p-intro}

This document is the first one in a series of documents that are
providing a comprehensive overview of Clouds, Big Data, and their
technologies and applications. Material from these volumes are used
selectively as part of this class.

\begin{IU}
They are developed within the Intelligent Systems Engineering department at
Indiana University. This courses are for students who are interested in
any component of the Masters or Ph.D. in Intelligent Systems
Engineering. It is an advanced elective class.
\end{IU}


The Series includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item (This document) {\bf Handbook of Clouds and Big Data}, Gregor von Laszewski,
  Geoffrey C. Fox, and Judy Qiu, Fall 2017,

\url{https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524/blob/master/project/projects.pdf}

\end{enumerate}

Our plan for this semester also includes the reorganization of some of
the volumes while sorting the contributions nto chapters with papers
from the same topic.

\FILENAME

\begin{description}

\item[Gregor von Laszewski] \index{von Laszewski, Gregor} Gregor von
  Laszewski is an Assistant Director DSC in the School of Informatics
  and Computing and Engineering at Indiana University. He holds also a
  position as Adjunct Professor in the Intelligent Systems Engineering
  Department. Previously he held Adjunct Professor positions at the
  Computer Science Department at Indiana University and University of
  North Texas. He received a Ph.D. from Syracuse University in
  computer science.

  At IU He served as the architect of the FutureGrid project. His
  current interest and projects include cloud computing, big data, and
  scientific impact metrics, and edge computing.  He initiated the
  Cloudmesh project which is a toolkit to enable cloud computing
  across various Cloud and Container IaaS such as OpenStack, AWS,
  Azure, docker, docker swarm, and kubernetes.


\item[Geoffrey C. Fox] \index{Fox, Geoffrey C} Fox received a Ph.D. in
  Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University and is now
  distinguished professor of Informatics and Computing, and Physics at
  Indiana University where he is director of the Digital Science
  Center, Chair of Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering and
  Director of the Data Science program at the School of Informatics,
  Computing, and Engineering.

  He currently works in applying computer science from infrastructure
  to analytics in Biology, Pathology, Sensor Clouds, Earthquake and
  Ice-sheet Science, Image processing, Deep Learning, Manufacturing,
  Network Science and Particle Physics. The infrastructure work is
  built around Software Defined Systems on Clouds and Clusters. The
  analytics focuses on scalable parallelism.

\item [Dr. Judy Qiu] is an Associate Professor in the School of
  Informatics and Computing at Indiana University. Her research
  interests focus on data-intensive computing at the intersection of
  cloud and multicore technologies, with an emphasis on life science
  applications using MapReduce as well as traditional parallel and
  distributed computing approaches. Her contributions are focused on
  Hadoop and Introduction into Cloud Computing.

targeted for Indiana University.

\section{About}

The material in this document is covering material that is or has been
used in the following classes at Indiana University.

\begin{itemize}
\item Undergraduate: E222 Intelligent systems II
\item Graduate: E516 Introduction to Cloud Computing
\item Graduate: E616 Advanced Cloud Computing
\item Graduate: E534 Big Data Applications
\item Graduate: I524 Big Data Applications and Open Source Software
\item Graduate: I523 Big Data Applications and Analytics
\end{itemize}

The format has been influenced by experiences gained from teachin I523
and I524 by Gregor von Laszewski.  The collection of this material is
updated continuously and new versions will be made available
throughout the semester. A timestamp on the front page indicates the
last time the document was updated.

\section{Other Results}\label{S:results}

Besides the documents posted in Section \ref{S:p-intro} a small set of
additional results exist in form of a video presentation.  However,
these results are older and we are no longer using such
presentations. To gurantee completness, we include them however in
this section

\section{Contributing}
\index{Contributing}

We encourage students of the classes to contribute to this document or
other volumes, provide corrections, and additions. This document is
managed on \verb|github.com| at

\URL{https://github.com/cloudmesh/book/}

\subsection{Class Contributions}

The current release version is held in the master branch.
Development versions will be held under a number of branches:

\begin{description}
\item[e222] Branch with contributions from students of the e222
  class. Merges to and from the {\em latex} branch will be conducted
  on a daily bases by TA's.
\item[e516] Branch with contributions from students of the e616
  class. Merges to and from the {\em latex} branch will be conducted
  on a daily bases by TA's.
\item[e616] Branch with contributions from students of the e616
  class. Merges to and from the {\em latex} branch will be conducted
  on a daily bases by TA's.
\item[dev] Branch managed by Gregor and the TA's
\item[master] Branch that contains the current released version. This
  version is updated once a week from the branch {\em latex}.
\end{description}

Contributions are to be conducted as pull requests. It is important to
keep the pull requests small and on a section or even paragraph
base. This helps avoiding conflicts at time of checkin and is a common
practice in large communities. It is not a good practice to work for
weeks on improvements and than issue the pull request. For sure things
will have changed and it will take you a long time to catch up.

The original document is based on selected material published and edited by Gregor von
Laszewski at the following Web page

\URL{https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/}

Based on feedback from students the desire to have the material in
book format available was raised and we have implemented it.


\subsection{Community Contributions}
\index{Contributing}

It is easy to contribute to this document and we invite everyone to
improve the material. To do so you need to fork the repository from 

\URL{https://github.com/cloudmesh/book/}

and clone it. Make sure you check out the {\em dev} branch. Then you
can modify information in the different files or add new sections. It
is important that you make changes based on sections and than for them
create a new pull request. This simplifies the review process. We will
typically want only one file to be changed. Aslo before you issue your
pull request make sure that no one else has already made changes. In
that case we ask you to integrate them into your document.
