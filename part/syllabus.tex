\section{Course Description}

This course describes the emerging cloud and big data technologies
within the world of distributed intelligent systems where each system
component has internal, and external sources of intelligence that are
subject to collective control. Examples are given from a wide variety
of applications. A project will allow students to dive into practical
issues after they have obtained a theoretical background.

\section{Course pre-requisites}

Python will be used as a Programming Languages. In some cases Java may
also be useful however it's use in class will be marginal. The class
will be using Linux commandline tools. Prior knowledge of Linux is of
advantage but not required.  Studnets are expected to have access to a
computer on which they can execute Linux easily. As the OS
requirements have recently increased we recommend a computer with 8GB
main memory and the ability to run virtualbox and/or containers. If it
turns out your machine is not capable enough we attempt to provide
access to IU linux machines.

\section{Teaching and learning methods}


\begin{itemize}
\item Lectures
\item Assignments including specific lab activities
\item Final project 
\end{itemize}

\section{Covered Topics}

The class will cover a number of topics as part of tracks that are
executed in parallel throughout the class. Although we assume that at
a graduate course level the communication track has already been
covered elsewhere, we made sure we also include it here in case you dod
not yet have such experiences.

\chapter{Course Management at IU}

We describe briefly how we manage different classes and how to
interact with us. 

\subsection{Communication and Use of CANVAS}

In the past we have found numerous limitations to CANVAS that makes it
not possible for us to use it effectively for this class. Such
limitations were not overcome even after consulting our professional
course support team at IU although we spend days and weeks trying to
fix the issues. We have been given the advice form IU to avoid using
CANVAS for certain things and like to point out to you our much
simpler approach:

\begin{itemize}

\item we use CANVAS notifications only for the initial class setup and
  notify you how to gain access to piazza where all class discussions
  take place;

\item any discussion about grades is done in CANVAS;

\item we will DELETE all e-mail send to us on personal e-mails. All
  discussions need to take place either in private or in public posts
  on piazza (other than grades which need to be send via CANVAS);

\item TAs are strictly forbidden to answer any mail that is not send
  via piazza;

\item any post to piazza to a TA must be not done to the individual TA
  but to {\em instructors};

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Online  and Office Hours}

To support you we have established an open policy of sharing
information not only as part of the class material, but also as part
of how we conduct support. We establish the following principals:

\begin{itemize}

\item in case of doubt how to communicate address this early in class
  and attend online hours;

\item all office hours if not of personal nature are open office hours
  meaning that any student in class can be joined by any member of the
  class and  all meeting times are posted publicly.

\item it is in your responsibility to attend in person classes and
  online hours as we found that those that do get better grades. For
  residential students participation is mandatory.

\item instructors of this class will attempt within reason to find
  suitable times for you to attend an online hour in case you are an
  online student. Residential students can attend the class on Friday
  and ask any question. 

\end{itemize}
