\chapter{E516: Introduction to Cloud Computing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We present the syllabus for the introduction to Cloud Computing course
taught at Indiana University that uses in part the material presented
in this document. The information includes the section or chapter
number, the name of the chapter or section, and the timeframe when it
is recommended to work through the material and the page number where
to find the material in this document. Please note that we will update
the document throughout the semester thus, pagenumbers will change. 

\section{Course Description}

This course describes the emerging cloud and big data technologies
within the world of distributed intelligent systems where each system
component has internal, and external sources of intelligence that are
subject to collective control. Examples are given from a wide variety
of applications. A project will allow students to dive into practical
issues after they have obtained a theoretical background.

\section{Course pre-requisites}

Python will be used as a Programming Languages. In some cases Java may
also be useful however it's use in class will be marginal. The class
will be using Linux commandline tools. Prior knowledge of Linux is of
advantage but not required.  Studnets are expected to have access to a
computer on which they can execute Linux easily. As the OS
requirements have recently increased we recommend a computer with 8GB
main memory and the ability to run virtualbox and/or containers. If it
turns out your machine is not capable enough we attempt to provide
access to IU linux machines.

\chapter{E616/I524: Advanced Cloud Computing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This class is also known under the name {\em I524 Big Data
Applications and Open Source Software.}
 

We present the syllabus for the E616 course taught at Indiana
University that uses in part the material presented in this
document. The information includes the section or chapter number, the
name of the chapter or section, and the timeframe when it is
recommended to work through the material and the page number where to

the document throughout the semester thus, page numbers will change.

\section{Course Description }

This course describes Cloud 3.0 in which DevOps, Microservices, and
Function as a Service is added to basic cloud computing. The
discussion is centered around the Apache Big Data Stack and a major
student project aimed at demonstrating integration of cloud
capabilities.

\section{Course pre-requisites}

Python will be used as a Programming Languages. It is expected that
you know a programming language. ENGR-E516 or an introduction to cloud
computing is recommended. Studnets are expected to have access to a
computer on which they can execute Linux easily. As the OS
requirements have recently increased we recommend a computer with 8GB
main memory and the ability to run virtualbox and/or containers. If it
turns out your machine is not capable enough we attempt to provide
access to IU linux machines.

\section{Course Registration}

I524 and E616 are identical. In this courses we will be focussing on
Advanced Cloud COmputing and Big Data Applications and Analytics.

\section{Lectures and Lecture Material}


\subsection{Proposed Weekly Agenda}

\begin{WARNING}

The following information is related to our initial plans of
presenting material for E222 by Week. Please note that this could
change. These are proposed topics and we will update the Handbook
accordingly from week to week.

\end{WARNING}


\subsubsection{Week 1. REST for Cloud computing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction to rest
\item Practical programming of a rest service in eve
\item Exercise: develop a rest service that returns some real
  information, such as memory of the computer, cpu type and so
  on. This is not read from a text file but life queried.
\item Exercise: show the process list in a RESET service
\item Exersise (Week 2): A+ projects develop REST services for big
  data while proposing a useful schema so it can be contributed to
  NIST
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Week 2. Setting up your development environment}

In this week we will work with you to complete the set up of your
development environment. We will introduce you to lectures about
Python programmig and the use pf PyCharm as editor.

Technologies covered:	piazza,	git,	pycharm,	virtualbox,	pyenv,	python

Exersise: Continue to work on REST service.

\subsubsection{Week 3. Overview of Cloud Services}

We will be introducing you how to use Cloud services offored via a
number of Cloud providers. Topics covered include: overview of AWS,
overview of Openstack, libcloud, and boto

\subsubsection{Week 4. Introduction to simple Containers}

We will be providing an introduction to containers and container
technologies. Excercises will include to run the REST services that we
developed earlier to start in containers and utilize them.

\subsubsection{Week 5. Introduction to Container Clusters}

We will be providing you with an introduction on how to not use one
server, but multiple servers to run containers on. This includes
docker swarm, kubernetes, (maybe mesos if time allows).
Exercises include the deployment of minikube that enables you to run
kubernetes on your computers. Alternatively access to a docker swarm
cluster may be provided.

\subsubsection{Week 6. Map Reduce}

In this section we will introduce you to the concept of Map reduce. We
will discuss systems such as Hadoop and Spark and how they differ. You
will be deploying via a container hadoop on your machine and use it to
gain hands on experience.

\subsubsection{Week 7. Multi cloud environments}

We will teach you how to create a multi cloud shell while leveraging
an abstract programming interface to easily switch betwen multiple
clouds. You can practically participate in helping to develop
interfaces to AWS, Azure, and OpenStack. As you have also worked with
containers, you can develop such interfaces also for containers
including frameworks such as kubernetes. We will be using libcloud to
simplify the abstraction.
	
\subsubsection{Week 8. Cloud Data and Applications}

We will cover a number of Application examples for Cloud computing. In
the second part we will focus on CLoud Data Services and how we access
data on the cloud. Exercises will include moving data between data
services. THis includes your own computer, box and google which both
are offered at IU.


\subsubsection{Other weeks}

All excersises in these weeks will develop REST services that {\em
  expose} machine leraning algorithms as service. Data will be either
passed along directly through parameters to the call, or on case of
large data a URL to the data source. The lessons from the previous
weeks will be helping you to achive this. It is not sufficient to just
run the algorithms, but you must be integrating them into a REST service.

Other weeks are not yet included here but will cover Artificial
Intelligence.

\item[Evaluation Paper1:] Create a paper about a cloud technology with
  our give class template in the git repository. If a paper is
  plagiarised you will receive an ``F'' and it is reported based on
  University policies.
\end{description}

\subsection{Theory Track}

\begin{itemize}
\item IaaS - OpenStack
\item PaaS - Hadoop
\item SaaS - SaaS with REST
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Evaluation Paper1:] Create a paper about a cloud technology with
  our give class template in the git repository. If a paper is
  plagiarized you will receive an ``F'' and it is reported based on
  University policies. The paper is in a directory called paper1. All
  images are in the directory paper1/images, the report is in
  report.tex, the content is in content.tex. It follows the template
  we provided. Submission of report.pdf is not allowed. We will create
  the report and check completness that way.

  Jan 8, Mon & Class Begins\\
  
  Jan 15, Mon 9am & Setup communication pathways for the class. (1)
  You must have created a github repository in our class repository.
  (2) You must be in the class Piazza.  (3) Motivation: if we can not
  communicate with you we can not conduct the class. Everyone must be
  in piazza and github timely.  \\
