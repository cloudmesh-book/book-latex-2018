SSH
===

If you do not know what ssh is we recommend that you [read up on
it](http://openssh.com/manual.html). However, the simple material
presented here will help you get started quickly. It can however not
replace the more comprehensive documentation. We also remommend that you
read this entire section first before you start past and copy style
tutorials as this will not allow you to understand the way ssh is used.
FOr this reason we start with the explanation of ssh and not the setup
on your machine. We want you to obtain first a solid overview of what
you need to do.

To access remote resources this is often achieved via SSH. You need to
provide a public ssh key to FutureSystem. We explain how to generate a
ssh key, upload it to the FutureSystem portal and log onto the
resources. This manual covers UNIX, Mac OS X, as well as Windows 10.

Generate a SSH key
------------------

First we must generate a ssh key with the tool
[ssh-keygen](http://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen). This program is
commonly available on most UNIX syste
ms (this includes Cygwin if you
installed the ssh module or use our pre-generated cygwin executable). It
will ask you for the location and name of the new key. It will also ask
you for a passphrase, which you **MUST** provide. Please use a strong
passphrase to protect it appropriately.

Some teachers and teaching assistants advice you to not use passphrases.
This is **WRONG** as it allows someone that gains access to your
computer to also gain access to all resources that have the public key.

In case you already have a ssh key in your machine, you can reuse it and
skip this whole section.

To generate the key, please type:

Example:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C localname@indiana.edu

This command requires the interaction of the user. The first question
is:

    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/localname/.ssh/id_rsa): 

We recommend using the default location ~/.ssh/ and the default name
id_rsa. To do so, just press the enter key.

Your *localname* is the username on your computer.

The second and third question is to protect your ssh key with a
passphrase. This passphrase will protect your key because you need to
type it when you want to use it. Thus, you can either type a passphrase
or press enter to leave it without passphrase. To avoid security
problems, you **MUST** chose a passphrase. Make sure to not just type
return for an empty passphrase:

    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

and:

    Enter same passphrase again:

If executed correctly, you will see some output similar to:

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/localname/.ssh/id_rsa): 
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /home/localname/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/localname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    34:87:67:ea:c2:49:ee:c2:81:d2:10:84:b1:3e:05:59 localname@indiana.edu

    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |.+...Eo= .       |
    | ..=.o + o +o    |
    |O.  = ......     |
    | = .   . .       |
    +-----------------+

Once, you have generated your key, you should have them in the `.ssh`
directory. You can check it by:

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If everything is normal, you will see something like:

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCXJH2iG2FMHqC6T/U7uB8kt
    6KlRh4kUOjgw9sc4Uu+Uwe/kshuispauhfsjhfm,anf6787sjgdkjsgl+EwD0

    ynEPUegkp+qYnR user@myemail.edu

Add or Replace Passphrase
-------------------------

In case you need to change your change passphrase, you can simply run
`ssh-keygen -p` command. Then specify the location of your current key,
and input (old and) new passphrases. There is no need to re-generate
keys:

    ssh-keygen -p

You will see the following output once you have completed that step:

    Enter file in which the key is (/home/localname/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Enter old passphrase:
    Key has comment '/home/localname/.ssh/id_rsa'
    Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.  

SSH Add and Agent
-----------------

To not always type in your password, you can use `ssh-add`.

It prompts the user for a private key passphrase and add it to a list of
keys managed by the ssh-agent. Once it is in this list, you will not be
asked for the passphrase as long as the agent is running.with your
public key.

To start the agent please use the following command:

    eval `ssh-agent`

It is important that you use the backquote ('), located under the tilde
( ), rather than the single quote ('). Once the agent is started it will
print a PID that you can use to interact with later

To add the key use the command

    ssh-add

To remove the agent use the command

    kill $SSH_AGENT_PID

To execute the command upon logout, place it in your `.bash_logout`
(assuming you use bash).

SSH Config
----------

\TODO{describe ssh config}
SSH Port Forwarding
-------------------

\TODO{describe port forwarding}
Upload the key to gitlab
------------------------

We do not use gitlab.com for most classes but use github.com

In case you use gitlab Follow the instructions provided here to upload
the public key

<http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html>
Using SSH on Mac OS X
---------------------

Mac OS X comes with an ssh client. In order to use it you need to open
the `Terminal.app` application. Go to `Finder`, then click `Go` in the
menu bar at the top of the screen. Now click `Utilities` and then open
the `Terminal` application.

Using SSH on Linux
------------------

All Linux versions come with ssh and can be used right from the
terminal.

Using SSH on Raspberry Pi 3
---------------------------

Install Rasbian on an SD card, and boot up your system. Before putting
it on the network, reset the default user password with the `passwd`
command.Now you can use the terminal and use ssh just like on any Linux
computer.

SSH on Windows
--------------

For this class we recommend that you use a virtual machine via virtual
box and use the Linux ssh instructions. The information here is just
provided for completness and no support will be offered for native
windows support.

Windows users need to have some special software to be able to use the
SSH commands. If you have one that you are comfortable with and know how
to setup key pairs and access the contents of your public key, please
feel free to use it.

On Windows you have a couple of options on running Linux commands such
as ssh. At this time it may be worth while to try the OpenSSH CLient
available for Windows, although it is in beta. If you like to use other
methods we have included alternatives.

### OpenSSH Client (Beta)

\TODO{provide us with screenshots of the  windows.}
In case you need access to ssh Microsoft has furtunately updated their
software to be able to run it directly from the Winodws commandline
including PowerShell.

However it is as far as we know not activated by default so you need to
follow some setup scripts. Also this software is considered beta and its
development and issues can be found at

<https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH>
<https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues>
What you have to do is to install it by going to `Settings > Apps` and
click `Manage optional features` under `Apps & features`.

Next, Click on the `Add feature`. You will be presented with a list in
which you scroll down, till you find `OpenSSH Client (Beta)`. Click on
it and invoke `Install`.

After the install has completed, you can use the `ssh` command. Just
type it in the commandshell or PowerShell

    PS C:\Users\gregor> ssh

Naturally you can now use it just as on Linux or OSX. and use it to
login to other resources

    PS C:\Users\gregor> ssh myname@computer.example.com

### Using SSH from Cygwin

One established way of using ssh is from using cygwin.

<http://cygwin.com/install.html>
Cygwin contains a collection of GNU and Open Source tools providing
Linux like functionality on Windows. A DLL is available that exposes the
POSIX API functionality.

A list of supported commands is available at

<https://cygwin.com/packages/package_list.html>
Please be minded that in order for cygwin to function easily the Windows
user name should not include spaces. However, as the setup in windows
encourages to use the full name whne you buy and setup a machine it may
not be convenient to use. However, we just recommend that you create
yourself a new username and use this if you like to use cygwin.

You can selectively install from the cygwin setup terminal which
software you like to use, obviously you may want to use ssh

### SSH from putty

As you will see the process is somewhat cumbersome and when you compare
it with the commandline tools available, we do recommend using them
instead.

PuTTY allows you to access the SSH, Telnet and Rlogin network protocols
from windows.

<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>
Although PuTTY has been out there for many years and served the
community well, it is not following the standard ssh command line syntax
when invoced from a command shell.

    putty -ssh user@host.name

In addition to using ssh, it also provides a copy command.

    pscp user@host.name:"\"remote filename with spaces\"" local_filename

Putty is best known for its GUI configuration application to manage
several machines as demonstrated next. Once you have downloaded it and
opened PuTTYgen, you will be presented with a a key generator window
(images provided by chameleon cloud) (see
Figure [\[F:putty-key\]](#F:putty-key){reference-type="ref"
reference="F:putty-key"}).

\FIGURE{htb} 
       {0.5}
       {images/chameleon/putty2.png}
       {Key generation window}
       {F:putty-key}
To generate a key you click the *Generate* button which is blue. The
PuTTY Key Generator (see
Figure [\[F:putty-pass\]](#F:putty-pass){reference-type="ref"
reference="F:putty-pass"}) will then ask you to move your mouse around
the program's blank space to generate "randomness" for your key. You
must enter a "Key passphrase" and then confirm the passphrase.

\FIGURE{htb} 
       {0.5}
       {images/chameleon/putty3.png}
       {Key generation window}
       {F:putty-pass}
Next you need to save both the public and private keys into a file of
your choice using the "Save public key" and "Save private key" buttons.
We suggest you name something obvious like "public\_key.pub" and
"private\_key" so that you can distinguish between the two.

Before closing this window, select the entire public key and copy it
with "Control-C". Please note that everything should be copied,
including "ssh-rsa". This will be used when importing the key pair to
Openstack.

At this time, the public key has been created and copied. Now you can
use the public key and upload it to systems you like to ligin to.

### Chocolatey

Another approach is to use it in Powershell with the help of chopolatey.
Other options may be better suited for you and we leave it up to you to
make this decission.

Chocolatey is a software management tool that mimics the install
experience that you have on Linux and OSX. It has a repository with many
packages. The packages are maintained by the community and you need to
evaluate security implications when installing packages hosted on
chocolatey just as you have to do if you install software on LInux and
OSX from their reporsitories. Please be aware that there could be
malicious code offered in the chocolatey repository although the
distributors try to remove them.

The installation is sufficently explained at

<https://chocolatey.org/install>
Once installed you have a command choco and you should make sure you
have the newest version with:

    choco upgrade chocolatey

Now you can browse packages at

<https://chocolatey.org/packages>
Search for openssh and see the results. You may find different versions.
Select the one that most suits you and satisfies your security
requirements as well as your architecture. Lets assume you chose the
Microsoft port, than you can install it with:

    choco install openssh

Naturally, you can also install cygwin and ptty over chocolatey. A list
of packages can be found at

<https://chocolatey.org/packages>
Packages of interest include

-   emacs: choco install emacs

-   pandoc: choco install pandoc

-   LaTeX: choco install miktex

-   jabref: choco install jabref

-   pycharm: choco install pycharm-community

-   lyx: choco install lyx

-   python 2: choco install python2

-   python 3: choco install python

-   pip: choco install pip

-   virtualbox: choco install virtualbox

-   vagrant: choco install vagrant

Before installing any of them evaluate if you need them and identify
security risks.

Tips
----

Use SSH keys

-   You will need to use ssh keys to access remote machines

No blank passphrases

-   In most cases you must use a passphrase with your key. In fact if we
    find that you use passwordless keys to futuresystems and to
    chameleon cloud resources, we may elect to give you an *F* for the
    assignment in question. There are some exceptions, but they will be
    clearly communicated to you in class. You will as part of your cloud
    drivers license test explain how you gain access to futuresystmes
    and chameleon to explicitly explain this point and provide us with
    reasosns what you can not do.

A key for each server

-   Under no circumstances copy the same private key on multiple
    servers. THis violates security best practices. Create for each
    server a new private key and use their public keys to gain access to
    the appropriate server.

Use SSH agent

-   So as to not to type in all the time the passphrase for a key, we
    recommend using ssh-agent to manage the login. This will be part of
    your cloud drivers license.

    But shut down the ssh-agent if not in use

keep an offline backup, put encrypt the drive

-   You may for some of our projects need to make backups of private
    keys on other servers you set up. If you like to make a backup you
    can do so on a USB stick, but make sure that access to the stick is
    encrypted. Do not stor anything else on that key and look it in a
    safe place. If you lose the stick, recreate all keys on all
    machines.

SSH to FutureSystems Resources
------------------------------

Next, you need to upload the key to the portal. You must be logged into
the portal to do so.

Step 1:

-   Log into the portal

    ![image](/images/portalLogin_0.png){width="50%"}

Step 2:

-   Click in the "ssh key" button or go directly to
    <https://portal.futuresystems.org/my/ssh-keys>

    ![image](/images/portalsshkey.png){width="50%"}

Step 3:

-   Click in the "add a public key" link.

    ![image](/images/portalclikaddkey_0.png){width="50%"}

Step 4:

-   Paste your ssh key into the box marked Key. Use a text editor to
    open the "id\_rsa.pub". Copy the entire contents of this file into
    the ssh key field as part of your profile information. Many errors
    are introduced by users in this step as they do not paste and copy
    correctly.

    ![image](/images/portalkeypaste_0.png){width="50%"}

Step 5:

-   Click the submit button. **IMPORTANT**: Leave the Title field blank.
    Make sure that when you paste your key, it does not contain newlines
    or carriage returns that may have been introduced by incorrect
    pasting and copying. If so, please remove them.

At this point, you have uploaded your key. However, you will still need
to wait till all accounts have been set up to use the key, or if you did
not have an account till it has been created by an administrator.
Please, check your email for further updates. You can also refresh this
page and see if the boxes in your account status information are all
green. Then you can continue.

Testing your ssh key
--------------------

If you have had no FutureSystem account before, you need to wait for up
to two business days so we can verify your identity and create the
account. So please wait. Otherwise, testing your new key is almost
instantaneous on india. For other clusters like it can take around 30
minutes to update the ssh keys.

To log into india simply type the usual ssh command such as:

    $ ssh portalname@india.futuresystems.org

The first time you ssh into a machine you will see a message like this:

    The authenticity of host 'india.futuresystems.org (192.165.148.5)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 11:96:de:b7:21:eb:64:92:ab:de:e0:79:f3:fb:86:dd.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes 

You have to type yes and press enter. Then you will be logging into
india. Other FutureSystem machines can be reached in the same fashion.
Just replace the name india, with the appropriate FutureSystems resource
name.
