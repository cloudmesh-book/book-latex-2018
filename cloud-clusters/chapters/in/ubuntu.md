 Ubuntu Development Configurations :o:
======================================

Development Configuration
-------------------------

The documentation on how to configure the virtual machine and install
many useful programs is posted at:

<https://github.com/cloudmesh/ansible-cloudmesh-ubuntu-xenial>
You simply have to execute the following commands in the terminal of the
virtual machine. In order to eliminate confusion with other terminals,
we use the prefix

    vm> $ 

to indicate any command that is to be started on the virtual machine.
Otherwise it is clear from the context:

    vm>$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudmesh/ansible-cloudmesh-ubuntu-xenial/master/bootstrap.sh
    vm>$ bash bootstrap.sh

A video showcasing this install is available:
