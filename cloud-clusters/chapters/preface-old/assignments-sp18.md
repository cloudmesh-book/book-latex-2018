Assignments
===========

Overview
--------

 

We will post in this part all assignments for the various classes. As
this page will be updated frequently, it is in the students
responsibility to check.

It is in the responsibility of the student to check this page and
complete the assignments. Some assignment may not be graded, but they
still have to be completed. To identify the assignment they carry the
name of the Lesson as well as a number. We try to alsoinclude a refernce
to the section where this assignment may be originating from.

The following are mandated assignments for this class

Due Dates
---------

If not explicitly mentioned here the due dates are posted in Section
[\[S:calendar\]](#S:calendar){reference-type="ref"

In addition we will post here some additional assignments, some of which
