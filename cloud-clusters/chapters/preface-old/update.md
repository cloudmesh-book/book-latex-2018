    Part [\[p:incomming\]](#p:incomming){reference-type="ref"

    tutorials in `book/tutorial` must use that directory from now on and

    valid for all residential students. For online students we have for
    now just provided a list in

    student also start adding the tutorials via a pull request and
    integrate them into the handbook. Some tutorials are obviously in
    draft form, so we like you to complete them. You may have noticed in
    some tutorials we have done significant modification. To simplify
    integration into the handbook we like you to provide the tutorial
    in md. Make sure to place images in an images directory, and bibtex
    in a bib file next to your tutorial. If unclear ask.
