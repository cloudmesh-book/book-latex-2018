:o: TODO: Gregor: add link to the piazza section

Next obtain some cloud accounts which you may use as part of the class:

2. Obtain an account on <https://github.com/>. Note this is not
   github.iu.edu and you may have a different account name on the
   systems. Please write down your *username* on github.com. Your
   username is not an e-mail.
3. Obtain an account on <https://portal.futuresystems.org/>. Please,
   write down your username.
4. Obtain an account on <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/>
5. Obtain an account on <https://portal.xsede.org/>. Please write down
   your username.

Make sure you chose strong passwords that you remember.

Once you have the accounts do the following:

6. Post a **formal** bio on piazza so you introduce yourself to the
   class. Please put in the firstline, your github.com username (**do
   not use your github.iu.edu username**)
   An example is available at

   :o: TODO: Gregor: include link to formal bio

7. **Wait till your HID directory on github.com is created**. Please do
   not send us e-mail, we watch piazza and add you within 1-2 buisiness
   days. You can check it on github.com if it is done.

After your HID directory is created you can continue, however you can
certainly prepare the information to be uploaded already on your
computer while you wait. 

8. Create a notebook.md file and place it in the root directory of
   your github.com hid repository. An example is provided at

   * <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sample/blob/master/notebook.md>

9. Create a README.yml file in teh rood directory of your github.com
   repository. Make sure to not use any TABS and use valid yaml. If
   you do not know what yaml is please find out, it is part of this
   assignment. AN example README.yml can be found at:

   * <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sample/blob/master/README.yml>

   You should remove the comments in your README.yml

Naturally, we want you to learn about the systems. The one you will
need to use immediatly know is piazza. 

10. :o: Learn about Piazza: <https://youtu.be/9hnW-327CMQ>. 

11. :o: :clapper: Watch the introduction video at:
    <https://youtu.be/yC3PNkb_9mI>. Naturally the video is for an
    older class so please ignore the links in it. 

Now that you have accomplished these easy taks it is time to take our
entry survey

12. :o: TODO: MAKE NEW ENTRY SURVEY Conduct the entry survey after you have done the above assignments:
    <https://piazza.com/class/j5wll7vzylg25j?cid=67>

Now it is time to buy some supplies. Obviously this class will need a
computer that you can use to login into the remote machines and do
your project. If you do not have such a computer, you can purchase a
Raspbery Pi with power plug for about $50. Otherwise use your laptop
or desktop. Detailed infprmation about such hardware are provided in
the Raspberry PI section.

Residential students have access to about 100 Raspberry PIs in the
Rasperry PI Lab in Smith Research Center (which may be relocated to MESH)
Resdidential students will have mandatory projects that will have to
be done on the Raspberry PIs. For online students thi sis optional.

---

:warning: Please note that we do not provide support for Windows. You
can certainly use virtualbox and install a newer version of ubuntu on it.

:warning: Windows 10 home has limitations and does
not allow you to use containers or proper virtualization. For this
reason we recommend that you upgrade to Woindows 10 pro or
eductaion. The eductaion version is available for free via IU. Please see
IUware and share your experince in piazza in your update. Whatever you
do, make a backup first.

:warning: OSX users have typically an easy time as all TAs have OSX
machines. However the version must be the latest version. We do not
support older versions.
