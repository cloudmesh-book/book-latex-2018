Please note some additional remarks to this table:

* The firs number indicates which  assignment a date relates to. Note
  we only have 4 assignments.

* In certain cases the TAs will contact you between Dec 1st - Dec 14th to ask
  you for clarifications, live demos and possibly suggest improvements
  to your project. If that is the case we expect that you are
  available during that time period to provide feedback and improve
  your project.

* No penalty project improvements can only be conducted if a full
  report has been handed in on Nov 26

* Penalty project improvements often lead to a better grade although a
  penalty applies. 

* Any project not handed in on Nov 26 runs the risk of you getting a
  grade reduction or an incomplete in case significant changes need to
  be done. This can be avoided by working on your project on a weekly
  basis.

* Good projects have typically worked thought the semester with the TAs and
  checked in their code and document regularly.

* We will not grade **any** of your assignments if you have not passed
  successfully the plagiarism certification.

* Additional assignments may be added throughout the semester.
