Graphviz
--------

Graph is a tool that allows you to visualize structural information
with the help of abstract graphs and networks. It is achhieved while
providing the graph with automatic layout algorithms so you can focus
on the creation of dependencies between nots through edges. The main
Web page is located at

    brew install graphviz

There is also an additional tool that is distributed by the community
that is called doteditor and can be installed with

    brew cask install doteditor

If you have issues with brew cask install, you can also install it by

Online versions of graphviz are also available, but we have not tested
them

-   <https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/>
-   <http://viz-js.com/>
-   <http://graphviz.it/\#/gallery/unix.gv>

There are many more versions available. Please contribute to this
section to improve it

### Usage

To use graphviz create a dot file and run the following command.

    dot -Tpng filename.dot -o filename.png

This will create a png file. Other formats are also possible such as
svg, or PDF

    dot -Tsvg filename.dot -o filename.svg
    dot -TPDF filename.dot -o filename.pdf

For inclsion in latex documents we recommend you create PDF output as it
has a much better quality and is maller in size than png.

### The Dot Format

An extensive documentation is provided at

* <https://graphviz.gitlab.io/documentation/>

From there we find also the most simpplest Hello World Graph>

    echo "digraph G {Hello->World}" | dot -Tpng > hello.png

### Exercise

\begin{exercise}
Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a rendered version of the graph in a specified format. Make sure you can pass the format as a parameter.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a URL of the rendered graph while storing the output onto a data server. The data server is another rest service, from which the result can be picked up. 
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
For IU students. Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a URL of the rendered graph while storing the output onto a data server. The data server is another rest service, from which the result can be picked up. Use box and/or google drive that are offered by IU as services. Make sure not to expose your passwords or access keys
