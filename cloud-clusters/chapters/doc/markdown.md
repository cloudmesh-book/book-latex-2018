Markdown is a simple markup language, however there is no precise
standard defined for it and implementations may have features not
supported by other implementations. Nevertheless, it provieds as imple
and easy way to quicly develop clean looking documents.

There are severla tools that make markdown attractive allowing to write
the text in one window while at the same time seeing the rendered out
put in another.

This includes

### Conversion with pandoc

Pandoc is a tool to convert file formats between each other. According
tho the Web page Pandoc can convert "Markdown, reStructuredText,
textile, HTML, DocBook, LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup,
TikiWiki markup, Creole 1.0, Vimwiki markup, OPML, Emacs Org-Mode,
Emacs Muse, txt2tags, Microsoft Word docx, LibreOffice ODT, EPUB, or
Haddock markup".

The Web page is located at.

* <https://pandoc.org/>

To convert files simply use the following commandline option `-o` to
specify the output format

    pandoc filename.md -o filename.tex

In our example we converted the md file to latex.

As this document is created with pandoc we encourage you to review our
Makefile to see how we use some more advanced featuers


### Mermaid

Mermaide is a graph generation tool that lets you create graphs and
diagrams with the help of a description language. It includes graphviz
and UML like diagrams, as well as gantt charts
