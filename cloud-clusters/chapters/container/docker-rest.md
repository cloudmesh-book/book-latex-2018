Dockerized REST Service
=======================

We discuss how to use Docker to deploy a REST service designed using
Python Flask.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to follow our discussion you will need a system on which you
can run docker. THis could either be OSX, LInux, or Windows.

Python 2.7.x can be used to do this tutorial

### Ubuntu and OSX

Please use our instructions on installying pyenv.

### Windows

We start with download Python:

[Download Python
MSI](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/python-2.7.14.msi)

After installing python add an environmental variable by pressing
Windows Key + Pause and Select Advanced system settings. Then add an
environment varible for system variables for the variable PATH which is
already there. And in that add the new variable

    C:\Python27

As older python versions do not come or come with an outdated version of
pip, we install it as follows:

[Download Pip Installer Script](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

Now copy this file to

    C:\Users\<your_username>\cloudmesh\bin

If you do not have this path please create it, because we will be using
this place to store all the tools we need. Within the bin folder run the
following commands using command line tool or cmd.exe in windows.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ python get-pip.py
```

Now add this environmental variable to PATH in System variables the same
way we did earlier by putting the following value

    C:\Python27\lib\site-packages
    C:\Python27\Scripts

After adding the variables make sure you use a new cmd.exe.

Now continue by installing a Virtualenv installation

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ pip install virtualenv 
```

Turn on Hyper-V (Windows Features Turn On and In the list selectHyber V)

Turn on Containers (Windows Features Turn On and In the list select
Hyber V)

Install emacs via chocolatey

Activate Virutal Environment
----------------------------

### Ubuntu and OSX

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ mkdir -p ~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask
$ cd ~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows

Using cmd.exe Please replace with your username.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ mkdir -p C:\Users\<your_username>\cloudmesh\containers\docker-flask
$ cd C:\Users\<your_username>\cloudmesh\containers\docker-flask
$ virtualenv venv
$ venv/Script/activate
```

Now you are inside the created virtual environment. The terminal will
look something like

``` {.bash language="bash"}
(venv) neo$
```

File Structure
--------------

The File structure takes the following look.

    docker-flask/[FOLDER]:[BASE PATH : ~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask]
        --|Dockerfile [FILE]
        --|requirements.txt [FILE]
        --|app/ [FOLDER]
            --|--|main.py [FILE]
            --|venv [FOLDER]

### Step 1

Create requirements.txt file

#### Ubuntu and OSX

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ emacs requirements.txt
```

#### Windows

Install an editor such as emacs on Windows. YOu can use chocolatey for
that, or use pycharm. Do not use notepad++

``` {.bash language="bash"}
emacs requirements.txt
```

Include the folllowing content in the requirements.txt file.

    Flask==0.11.1

Now run the following command

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2

Then we are going to create thr Dockerfile which includes all the
instructions for the deployment of the REST API on docker.

#### Ubuntu and OSX

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ emacs Dockerfile
```

#### Windows

``` {.bash language="bash"}
emacs Dockerfile
```

Include the following content in the Dockerfile

    FROM tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:flask
    COPY ./app /app

Here we have created a minimal Dockerfile.

FROM: command tells the image that has to be pulled from the Docker hub.
So in this case for the ease of the task and to keep it simple with
minimum packages we are going to select an image including nginx, flask
and uWSGI.

1.  Nginx: An open source software for web serving capability.

2.  Flask: REST API package in Python

3.  uWSGI: A server and one of the protocols implemented in WSGI which
    is a protocol used for pure HTTP communications and load balancing.

So this image includes everything we need to work on this tutorial.

COPY: Here it will copy content from app folder created in local machine
to the Docker container.

Now the Dockerfile is completed and we have everything needed to build a
docker image.

### Step 3

Then we need to creat the main.py file inside the app folder.

#### Ubuntu and OSX

``` {.bash language="bash"}
emacs app/main.py
```

#### Windows

``` {.bash language="bash"}
emacs app/main.py
```

Then add the following content.

``` {language="python"}
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hey I am using Docker!"

@app.route("/api/cpu")
def get_cpu():
# ADD CODE TO GET CPU INFO
# USE psutil LIBRARY
    return "SHOW YOUR CPU INFO"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", debug=True, port=80)
```

After adding the content save and exit emacs.

Build Docker Image
------------------

### Ubuntu and OSX

Now run the following commands.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ cd ~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask
$ docker build -t sample-flask-rest-app .
```

### Windows

Run Powershell as administrator and replace with your username.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
cd C:\Users\<your_username>\cloudmesh\containers\docker-flask
docker build -t sample-flask-rest-app .
```

If it builds successfully, you will get the following response

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ docker build -t sample-flask-rest-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  19.15MB
Step 1/2: FROM tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python2.7
 ---> ec43f17def9a
Step 2/2: COPY ./app /app
 ---> e8eb1bff86b8
Successfully built e8eb1bff86b8
Successfully tagged sample-flask-rest-app:latest

Note: Changing any content inside the app folder must be
      updated in the container by rebuilding the image.
```

Run Docker Image
----------------

Run the following commands to get the REST API hosted on
<http://127.0.0.1:80>

### Ubuntu and OSX

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ docker run -p 80:80 -t sample-flask-rest-app
```

### Windows

In Windows powershell Run as adminstrator (use the previous powershell
window)

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ docker run -p 80:80 -t sample-flask-rest-app
```

Here you may have to grant permission for using this port number. So
please allow that to run.

It will take sometime to load the server once.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ docker run -p 80:80 -t sample-flask-rest-app
```

If it is loaded and if it runs successfully you will see a response
similar to

``` {.bash language="bash"}
Checking for script in /app/prestart.sh
Running script /app/prestart.sh
Running inside /app/prestart.sh, you could add migrations to this file, e.g.:

#! /usr/bin/env bash

# Let the DB start
sleep 10;
# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head
