Introduction to Containers
==========================

This section covers an introduction to containers that is split up into
four parts. We discuss microservices, serverless computing, Docker, and
kubernetes.

Motivation - Microservices
--------------------------

We discuss the motivation for containers and contrast them to virtual
machines. Additionally we provide a motivation for containers as they
can be used to microservices.

Motivation - Serverless Computing
---------------------------------

We enhance our motivation while contrasting containers and microservices
while relating them to serverless computing. We anticipate that
serverless computing will increase in importance over the next years

Docker
------

In order for us to use containers, we go beyond the historial motivation
that was introduced in a previous section and focus on Docker a
predominant technology for containers on Windows, Linux, and OSX

Docker and Kubernetes
---------------------

We continue our discussion about docker and introduce kubernetes,
allowing us to run multiple containers on multiple servers building a
cluster of containers.

QEMU and KVM
------------

We discuss the underlying virtualization technologies used by OpenStack
and public cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
