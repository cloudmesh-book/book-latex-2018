What is Kubernetes?
-------------------

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying,
scaling, and operating application containers.

* <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/>

With Kubernetes, you can:

-   Deploy your applications quickly and predictably.

-   Scale your applications on the fly.

-   Roll out new features seamlessly.

-   Limit hardware usage to required resources only.

-   Run applications in public and private clouds.

Kubernetes is

-   Portable: public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud

-   Extensible: modular, pluggable, hookable, composable

-   Self-healing: auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication,
    auto-scaling

What are containers?

Terminology
-----------

Pods:

:   A pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more
    containers (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network,
    and a specification for how to run the containers. A pod's contents
    are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context.
    A pod models an application-specific *logical host*. It contains one
    or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled.
    In a pre-container world, they would have executed on the same
    physical or virtual machine.

Services:

:   Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a
    policy by which to access them. Sometimes they are called a
    micro-service. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is (usually)
    determined by a Label Selector.

Deployments:

:   A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and
    ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment object,
    and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the
    desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to
    create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt
    all their resources with new Deployments.

Minikube
--------

1.  minikube installation

2.  minikube hello-minikube

### Install minikube

##### OSX

``` {.bash language="bash"}
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.25.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

##### Windows 10

We assume that you have installed Oracle VirtualBox in your machine
which must be a version 5.x.x.

Initially, we need to download two executables.

[Download
Kubectl](http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.4.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe)

[Download
Minikube](https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.25.0/minikube-windows-amd64.exe)

After downloading these two executables place them in the cloudmesh
directory we earlier created. Rename the `minikube-windows-amd64.exe` to
`minikube.exe`. Makesure minikube.exe and kubectl.exe lie in the same
directory.

##### Linux

``` {.bash language="bash"}
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.25.0/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Installing KVM2 is important for Ubuntu distributions

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ sudo apt install libvirt-bin qemu-kvm
$ sudo usermod -a -G libvirtd $(whoami)
$ newgrp libvirtd
```

We are going to run minikube using KVM2 libraries instead of virtualbox
libraries for windows installation.

Then install the drivers for KVM2,

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/docker-machine-driver-kvm2 && chmod +x docker-machine-driver-kvm2 && sudo mv docker-machine-driver-kvm2 /usr/bin/
```

### Start a cluster using Minikube

##### OSX Minikube Start

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ minikube start
```

##### Ubuntu Minikube Start

``` {.bash language="bash"}
minikube start --vm-driver=kvm2
```

##### Windows 10 Minikube Start

In this case you must run Windows PowerShell as administrator. For this
search for the application in search and right click and click Run as
administrator. If you are an administrator it will run automatically but
if you are not please make sure you provide the admin login information
in the pop up.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ cd  C:\Users\<username>\Documents\cloudmesh
$ .\minikube.exe start --vm-driver="virtualbox"
```

### Create a deployment

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ kubectl run hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4 --port=8080
```

### Expose the service

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort
```

### Check running status

This step is to make sure you have a pod up and running.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ kubectl get pod
```

### Call service api

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ curl $(minikube service hello-minikube --url)
```

### Take a look from Dashboard

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ minikube dashboard
```

If you want to get an interactive dashboard,

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ .\minikube.exe dashboard --url=true
http://192.168.99.101:30000
```

Browse to http://192.168.99.101:30000 in your web browser and it will
provide a GUI dashboard regarding minikube.

### Delete the service and deployment

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ kubectl delete service hello-minikube
$ kubectl delete deployment hello-minikube
```

### Stop the cluster

For all platforms we can use the following command.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ minikube stop
```
