## PI Clusters on the Internet

There is a large number of projects related to creating PI clusters on
the internet. The project vary in size and platform. Naturally a PI
cluster is a useful training and development environment for research
organizations and thus many bigger projects are located at
universities as well as government labs.

However we also have many projects done by enthusisats.

We distinguish two different efforts. First, we often find projects
that targetthe creation of cases for such clusters and second, we find
projects that develop software fort these clusters.
This section will provide an overview of these activities. 


### Cluster Cases

#### Lego

When looking at the placement of the wholes on the Raspbery PI, the
width between the wholes on the small side seems to be exactly 7 lego
technic beam wholes appart. This has the advantage that one could
buidla quick frame form lego pieces such as a 2 * 11 ($0.22) piece +
2 * a two piece * 4 * 4 ($0.192). The cost is about $0.25 per piece =
$2.74 per pi. So if we are having 100 pis we end up with $274. However
we also need still to get screw and lego conectors.
