# Raspberry PI

Raspberry PIs are a convenient cheap compute platform that allow us to
explore setting up cloud clusters with varous software that otherwise
woudl not be accessible to most. The point is not to create a comnplex
compute platform, but to create a *testbed* in which we can explore
configuration aspects and prepare benchmarks that are run on larger
and expensive cloud environments.

In addition Raspbery Pis can be used as a simple Linux terminal to log
into other machines.

We will give a small introduction to the platform next.

## Raspery PI 3 B

Till February 2018 the Raspery PI 3 B was the newest model. Within
thic class we have access to about 100 of them.

Figure [Pi3](#F-pi3) shows the Raspberry PI 3 B.

* 4 Pole stereo output and composite video port
* Full size HDMI
* CSI camera port for connecting a Raspberry Pi camera
* DSI display port for connecting a Raspberry Pi touchscreen display
* Micro SD port for loading your operating system and storing data
* Switched Micro USB power source up to 2.5A

## Raspberry PI 3 B+

We plan to purchase a number of them so we can conduct performance
experiements and leverage the faster hardware.

Figure [Pi3+](#F-pi3p) shows the newest Raspberry PI 3 B+.
