\section{Installation of Hadoop}

In this section we use Hadoop 3.0.0 and we install Hadoop locally in
Ubuntu 16.04.

\subsection{Instalation}

In this section we will document how to install Hadoop along with the Yarn
resource manager. We assume that you have ssh, and rsync installed.

\subsubsection{Prerequisits}

\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt-get install ssh
sudo apt-get install rsync
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{User and User Group Creation}

For security reasons we will install hadoop in a particular user and
user group. We will use the following

\begin{lstlisting}
sudo addgroup hadoop_group
sudo adduser --ingroup hadoop_group hduser1
sudo adduser hduser sudo
\end{lstlisting}

%\footnote{Q for TAs: why are we using hduser and not just hduser?}

These steps will provide sudo privileges to the created hduser
user and add the user to the group \verb|hadoop_group|.

\subsubsection{Configuring SSH}

\begin{NOTE}
  Here we configure SSH key for the local user to install hadoop with a ssh-key.
  This is different from the ssh-key you used for Github, FutureSystems, etc.
  Follow this section to configure it for Hadoop installation. 
\end{NOTE}

The ssh content is included here because, we are making a
ssh key for this specific user. 
Next, we have to configure ssh to be used by the hadoop user.

%SUDO USER
\begin{lstlisting}
su - hduser
\end{lstlisting}
%SUDO USER

\begin{lstlisting}
ssh-keygen -t rsa
\end{lstlisting}

Follow the instructions as provided in the commandline.
When you see the following console input, press ENTER. Here only we
will create password less keys. IN general this is not a good idead,
but for this case we make an exception.

\begin{lstlisting}
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hduser/.ssh/id_rsa):
\end{lstlisting}

Next you will be asked to enter a password for ssh configuration,

\begin{lstlisting}
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
\end{lstlisting}

Here enter the same password

\begin{lstlisting}
Enter same passphrase again:
\end{lstlisting}

Finally you will see something like this after these steps are finished.

\begin{lstlisting}
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hduser/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/hduser/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/hduser/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/hduser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:0UBCPd6oYp7MEzCpOhMhNiJyQo6PaPCDuOT48xUDDc0 hduser@computer
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|    .+ooo        |
| .   oE.oo       |
|+  .. ...+.      |
|X+=  .  o..      |
|XX.o  o.S        |
|Bo+ + .o         |
|*o * +.          |
|*.. *.           |
| +.o..           |
+----[SHA256]-----+
\end{lstlisting}
%$

You have successfully configured ssh.

\subsubsection{Install Java}

If you are already logged into su, you can skip the next command:

\begin{lstlisting}
su - hduser
\end{lstlisting}

Now execute the following commands to download and install java

\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir -p ~/cloudmesh/bin
cd ~/cloudmesh/bin
wget -c --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u161-b12/2f38c3b165be4555a1fa6e98c45e0808/jdk-8u161-linux-x64.tar.gz"
tar xvzf jdk-8u161-linux-x64.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Installation Of Hadoop}

First we will take a look on how to install Hadoop 2.6.0 on Ubuntu
16.04. We may need a prior folder structure to do the installation
properly.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd ~/cloudmesh/bin/
wget http://mirrors.sonic.net/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.0.0/hadoop-3.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf hadoop-3.0.0.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Add Environmental Variables}

In Ubuntu the environmental variables are setup in a file called bashrc
at it can be accessed the following way

\begin{lstlisting}
emacs ~/.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
export JAVA_HOME=~/cloudmesh/bin/jdk1.8.0_161
export HADOOP_HOME=~/cloudmesh/bin/hadoop-3.0.0
export YARN_HOME=$HADOOP_HOME
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop
export PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
\end{lstlisting}

In Emacs to save the file \verb|Ctrl-X-S| and \verb|Ctrl-X-C| to exit. After editing
you must update the variables in the system.

\begin{lstlisting}
source ~/.bashrc
java -version
\end{lstlisting}

If you have installed things properly there will be no errors. It will
show the version as follows,

\begin{lstlisting}
java version "1.8.0_161"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode)
\end{lstlisting}

And verifying the hadoop installation,

\begin{lstlisting}
hadoop
\end{lstlisting}

If you have successfully installed this, there must be a message shown
as below.

\begin{lstlisting}
Usage: hadoop [--config confdir] COMMAND
       where COMMAND is one of:
  fs                   run a generic filesystem user client
  version              print the version
  jar <jar>            run a jar file
  checknative [-a|-h]  check native hadoop and compression libraries availability
  distcp <srcurl> <desturl> copy file or directories recursively
  archive -archiveName NAME -p <parent path> <src>* <dest> create a hadoop archive
  classpath            prints the class path needed to get the
  credential           interact with credential providers
                       Hadoop jar and the required libraries
  daemonlog            get/set the log level for each daemon
  trace                view and modify Hadoop tracing settings
 or
  CLASSNAME            run the class named CLASSNAME

Most commands print help when invoked w/o parameters.
\end{lstlisting}
