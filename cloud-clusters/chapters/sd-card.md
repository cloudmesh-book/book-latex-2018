## Install Raspbian on an SD card  [:cloud:](https://github.com/cloudmesh/book/blob/master/cloud-clusters/sd-card.md)

For many projects we need to install an Operating system on an SD
card. We have chose the OS **Raspbian** as it is widely
supported. Other OS have recently been added to the available OSes for
the PI, but we will at thsi time not consider them here.

To install the OS on an SD Card you will need another computer. We
describe next the process if you have either a MAC or an Linux ubuntu
machine. If you have other OSes and like to contribute, please add
your suggestions.

### OSX

First, we assume you have Etcher installed on your OSX machine

* You just need to download Etcher and install it. YOU can find the program at
  <https://etcher.io/>


Next, you need to download the image and place it in a directory. We
recommend to keep it in the `~/Download` directory.

1. Download the image from <https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest>

Once the image is downloaded you copy it with etcher onto the SD-card.

2. Place an SD Card into a SD card reader we recommend a 32GB card.

3. Attach the card reader to the computer

4. Open Etcher and select the downloaded `.img` or `.zip`
   file which you will likely find in the `~/Download` folder if you
   followed our previous steps

5. Select the SD card to write the image to.

6. Review selections and click *Flash!* to begin writing data to the SD
  card.

### Ubuntu

* In the file explorer, right click on the sd card and format the sd card
* Run

  ```bash
  $ df -h```

  to list all the drives in the computer
* Insert the sd card and run the command again
* Now a new entry will be listed which is the sd card
* The left column of the results from `df -h` command gives the device name of your SD card.
  It will be listed as something like `/dev/mmcblk0p1` or `/dev/sdX1`,
  where X is a lower case letter indicating the device.
  The last part (p1 or 1 respectively) is the partition number.
* Note down the name of the SD card (without the partition)
* Unmount the card so that the card can not be read from or written to
* Run the following command: 

  ```unmount dev/mmcblk0p1``` 

  Make sure to use correct name for the card
* If your card has multiple partitions unmount all partitions
* Next write the image to the sd card.
* Run the following command:

  ```$ dd bs=4M if=<path to .img> of=/dev/mmcblk0 status=progress conv=fsunc```
  
  Make sure `if=` contains the path to image and `of=` contains the name 
  of the sd card otherwise you may ruin your hard disk

#### Checking that the image was written properly

* Create an image again from the sd card
* Run the following command:

  ```$ dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdX of=from-sd-card.img```
  
* Truncate the image to be the the same size as that of the raspbian image

  ```$ truncate --reference <original raspbian image> from-sd-card.img```
  
* Run diff to see if the two files are same
* Run the following command:

  ```diff -s from-sd-card.img <original raspbian image>```
  
* Diff should say that the two files are same
