Physics
-------

This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and
evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson.
The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman
diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is
devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson
production with various forms of shape of signal and various background
and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple
principles of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they
are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces
Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in
natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random
Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial
and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

#### Particle Counting

We return to particle case with slides used in introduction and stress
that particles often manifested as bumps in histograms and those bumps
need to be large enough to stand out from background in a statistically
significant fashion.

#### Event Counting

We define *event counting* data collection environments. We discuss the
python and Java code to generate events according to a particular
scenario (the important idea of Monte Carlo data). Here a sloping
background plus either a Higgs particle generated similarly to LHC
observation or one observed with better resolution (smaller measurement
error).

#### Monte Carlo

This uses Monte Carlo data both to generate data like the experimental
observations and explore effect of changing amount of data and changing
measurement resolution for Higgs.

#### Random Variables, Physics and Normal Distributions

whats going on with a plot of expected Higgs production experimental
cross sections (probabilities) for signal and background.

#### Statistics of Events with Normal Distributions

We introduce Poisson and Binomial distributions and define independent
identically distributed (IID) random variables. We give the law of large
numbers defining the errors in counting and leading to Gaussian
distributions for many things. We demonstrate this in Python
experiments.

##### Interpretation of Probability: Bayes v. Frequency

This lesson describes difference between Bayes and frequency views of
probability. Bayes's law of conditional probability is derived and
applied to Higgs example to enable information about Higgs from multiple
channels and multiple experiments to be accumulated.

### Radar

The changing global climate is suspected to have long-term effects on
much of the world's inhabitants. Among the various effects, the rising
sea level will directly affect many people living in low-lying coastal
regions. While the ocean-s thermal expansion has been the dominant
contributor to rises in sea level, the potential contribution of
discharges from the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may
provide a more significant threat due to the unpredictable response to
the changing climate. The Radar-Informatics unit provides a glimpse in
the processes fueling global climate change and explains what methods
are used for ice data acquisitions and analysis.

#### Introduction

This lesson motivates radar-informatics by building on previous
discussions on why X-applications are growing in data size and why
analytics are necessary for acquiring knowledge from large data. The
lesson details three mosaics of a changing Greenland ice sheet and
provides a concise overview to subsequent lessons by detailing
explaining how other remote sensing technologies, such as the radar, can
be used to sound the polar ice sheets and what we are doing with radar
images to extract knowledge to be incorporated into numerical models.

This lesson focuses on the use of sophisticated computer vision
algorithms, such as active contours and a hidden markov model to support
