Introduction to Cloud Computing
===============================

This introduction to Cloud Computing covers all aspects of the field
drawing on industry and academic advances. It makes use of analyses from
the Gartner group on future Industry trends. The presentation is broken
into 21 parts starting with a survey of all the material covered. Note
this first part is A while the substance of the talk is in parts B to U.

Part A
---------------------

    in the data center and its technologies and the Gartner hypecycle
    and priority matrix on Infrastructure Strategies and Compute
    Infrastructure.

    Computing enhanced Apache Big Data Stack) with over 350 software
    packages and how to use each of its 21 layers.

-   Part K is first on **Cloud Applications** covering those from
    industry and commercial usage patterns from NIST.

-   Part L is second on **Cloud Applications** covering those from
    science where area called cyberinfrastructure; we look at the
    science usage pattern from NIST.

-   Part M is third on **Cloud Applications** covering the
    characterization of applications using the NIST approach.

-   Part N covers **Clouds and Parallel Computing** and compares Big
    Data and Simulations.

-   Part O covers **Cloud storage**: Cloud data approaches:
    Repositories, File Systems, Data lakes.

-   Part P covers **HPC and Clouds** with The Branscomb Pyramid and
    Supercomputers versus clouds.

-   Part Q compares **Data Analytics with Simulation** with application
    and software implications.

-   Part R compares **Jobs** from Computer Engineering, Clouds, Design
    and Data Science/Engineering.

-   Part S covers the **Future** with Gartner cloud computing hypecycle
    and priority matrix, Hyperscale computing, Serverless and FaaS,
    Cloud Native and Microservices.

-   Part T covers **Security and Blockchain**.

-   Part U covers **Fault-Tolerance**.
