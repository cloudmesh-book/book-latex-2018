# Assembling a Pi Cluster :o:

First, aluminium and copper heat syncs need to be attached to each
Pi. The two aluminium heat syncs are attached to the Broadcom chip and
the SMSC ethernet controller located on the top of the Pi. The blades
of the heat syncs are parallel to the longer side of the Pi as shown
inBlack aluminum fanned heat syncs are attached to the top of the pi
as shown in Figure 1.

Flat copper heat sync is attached to the bottom of the pi as shown in
Figure 2.

After attaching the heat syncs, threaded hexagonal spacer supports are
used to connect the Pis together. A fully-assembled 5-node Pi cluster
is shown in Figure 3.

Each node of the cluster is then attached to the switch using an
ethernet cables and to the power supply using a usb cables. The fully
wired cluster is shown in Figure 4
