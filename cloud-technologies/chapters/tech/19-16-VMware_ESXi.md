VMware ESXi (formerly ESX) is an enterprise-class, type-1 hypervisor
developed by VMware for deploying and serving virtual
computers [@wiki-vmwareESXi]. The name ESX originated as an
abbreviation of Elastic Sky X. ESXi installs directly onto your
physical server enabling it to be partitioned into multiple logical
servers referred to as virtual machines.  Management of VMware ESXi is
done via APIs. This allows for an \textit{agent-less} approach to
hardware monitoring and system management. VMware also provides remote
command lines, such as the vSphere Command Line Interface (vCLI) and
PowerCLI, to provide command and scripting capabilities in a more
controlled manner. These remote command line sets include a variety of
commands for configuration, diagnostics and troubleshooting. For
low-level diagnostics and the initial configuration, menu-driven and
command line interfaces are available on the local console of the
server [@vmware-esxi].
