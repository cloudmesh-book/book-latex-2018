CDAP [@www-cdap] stands for Cask Data Application Platform. CDAP
is an application development platform using which developers can
build, deploy and monitor applications on Apache Hadoop. In a typical
CDAP application, a developer can ingest data, store and manage
datasets on Hadoop, perform batch mode data analysis, and develop web
services to expose the data.  They can also schedule and monitor the
execution of the application. This way, CDAP enables the developers to
use single platform to develop the end to end application on Apache
Hadoop.

CDAP documentation [@www-cdap-docs] explains the important CDAP
concepts of CDAP Dataset, CDAP Application and CDAP Services. CDAP
Datasets provide logical abstraction over the data stored in
Hadoop. CDAP Applications provide containers to implement application
business logic in open source processing frameworks like map reduce,
Spark and real time flow. CDAP applications also provide standardize
way to deploy and manage the apps. CDAP Services provide services for
application management, metadata management, and streams management.
CDAP can be deployed on various Hadoop Platforms such as Apache
Hadoop, Cloudera Hadoop, Hortonworks Hadoop and Amazon EMR.  CDAP
sample apps [@github-cdap-sample-apps] provide explain how to
implement apps on CDAP platform.
