Hazelcast is a java based, in memory data grid [@www-wikihazel].
It is open source software, released under the Apache 2.0
License [@www-githubhazel]. Hazelcast enables predictable scaling
for applications by providing in memory access to data.  Hazelcast
uses a grid to distribute data evenly across a cluster. Clusters allow
processing and storage to scale horizontally. Hazelcast can run
locally, in the cloud, in virtual machines, or in Docker
containers. Hazelcast can be utilized for a wide variety of
applications. It has APIs for many programing languages including
Python, Java, Scala, C++, .NET and Node.js and supports any binary
languages through an Open Binary Client Protocol [@www-wikihazel].
