Apache Airavata [@www-airavata] is a software framework that
enables you to compose, manage, execute, and monitor large scale
applications and workflows on distributed computing resources such as
local clusters, supercomputers, computational grids, and computing
clouds. Scientific gateway developers use Airavata as their middleware
layer between job submissions and grid systems. Airavata supports long
running applications and workflows on distributed computational
resources. Many scientific gateways are already using Airavata to
perform computations (e.g. Ultrascan [@www-ultrascan],
SEAGrid [@www-seagrid] and GenApp [@www-genapp]).
