H-Store is an in memory and parallel database management system for
on-line transaction processing (OLTP). Specifically, it has been
illustrated that H-Store is a highly distributed, row-store-based
relational database that runs on a cluster on shared-nothing, main
memory executor nodes [@www-Hstore].  H-store trends have been
decibred as

The H-store which is a
complete redesign has the potential to outperform legacy OLTP
databases by a significant factor.  H-Store is the first
implementation of a new class of parallel DBMS, called NewSQL, that
provides the high-throughput and high-availability of NoSQL systems,
but without giving up the transactional guarantees of a traditional
DBMS [@www-Hstorewiki]. The H-Store system is able to scale out
horizontally across multiple machines to improve throughput, as
opposed to moving to a more powerful, more expensive machine for a
single-node system.
