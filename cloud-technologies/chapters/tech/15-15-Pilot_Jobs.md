In pilot job, an application acquires a resource so that it can be
delegated some work directly by the application; instead of requiring
some job scheduler. The issue of using a job scheduler is that a
waiting queue is required. Few examples of Pilot Jobs are
the [@pilot-job-falkon-paper-2007] Falkon lightweight framework
and [@pilot-job-htcaas-paper-2007] HTCaaS. Pilot jobs are
typically associated with both Parallel computing as well as
Distributed computing. Their main aim is to reduce the dependency on
queues and the associated multiple wait times.

Using pilot jobs enables us to have a multilevel technique for the
execution of various workloads. This is so because the jobs are
typically acquired by a placeholder job and they relayed to the
workloads [@www-pilot-job-paper-2016].
