Granules in used for execution or processing of data streams in
distributed environment.  When applications are running concurrently
on multiple computational resources, granules manage their parallel
execution.  The MapReduce implementation in Granules is responsible
for providing better performance. It has the capability of expressing
computations like graphs.  Computations can be scheduled based on
periodicity or other activity.  Computations can be developed in C,
C++, Java, Python, C\#, R It also provides support for extending basic
Map reduce framework.  Its application domains include hand writing
recognition, bio informatics and computer brain
interface [@www-granules].
