Caffe is a deep learning framework made with three terms namely
expression, speed and modularity [@www-caffe]. Using Expressive
architecture, switching between CPU and GPU by setting a single flag
to train on a GPU machine then deploy to commodity cluster or mobile
devices.Here the concept of configuration file will comes without hard
coding the values. Switching between CPU and GPU can be done by
setting a flag to train on a GPU machine then deploy to commodity
clusters or mobile devices.

It can process over 60 million images per day with a single NVIIA k40
GPU It is being used bu academic research projects, startup
prototypes, and even large-scale industrial applications in vision,
speech, and multimedia.
