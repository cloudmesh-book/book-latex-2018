The Global Federated File System (GFFS) is a computing technology that
allows linking of data from Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, AFS, and Lustre
file systems into a global namespace, making them available to
multiple systems [@www-gffs].  It is a federated, secure,
standardized, scalable, and transparent mechanism to access and share
resources across organizational boundaries It is useful when, for data
resources, boundaries do not require application modification and do
not disrupt existing data access patterns. It uses FUSE to handle
access control and allows research collaborators on remote systems to
access a shared file system. Existing applications can access
resources anywhere in the GFFS without modification. It helps in rapid
development of code, which can then be exported via GFFS and
implemented in-place on a given computational resource or Science
Gateway.
