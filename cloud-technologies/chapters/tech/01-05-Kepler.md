Kepler, scientific workflow application, is designed to help
scientist, analyst, and computer programmer create, execute and share
models and analyses across a broad range of scientific and engineering
disciplines.  Kepler can operate on data stored in a variety of
formats, locally and over the internet, and is an effective
environment for integrating disparate software components such as
merging \textit{R} scripts with compiled \textit{C} code, or facilitating remote,
distributed execution of models. Using Kepler's GUI, users can simply
select and then connect pertinent analytical components and data
sources to create a \textit{scientific workflow}. Overall, the Kepler helps
users share and reuse data, workflow, and components developed by the
scientific community to address common needs [@www-kepler].
