Totem is a project to overcome the current challenges in graph
algorithms.  The project is research the Networked Systems Laboratory
(NetSysLab) The issue resides in the scale of real world graphs and
the inability to process them on platforms other than a supercomputer.
Totem is based on a bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model that can
enable hybrid CPU/GPU systems to process graph based applications in a
cost effective manner [@www-netsyslab].
