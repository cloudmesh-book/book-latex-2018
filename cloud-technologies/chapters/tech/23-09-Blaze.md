Blaze library translates NumPy/Pandas-like syntax to data computing
systems (e.g. database, in-memory, distributed-computing). This
provides Python users with a familiar interface to query data in a
variety of other data storage systems.  One Blaze query can work
across data ranging from a CSV file to a distributed database.

Blaze presents a pleasant and familiar interface regardless of what
computational solution or database we use (e.g. Spark, Impala, SQL
databases, No-SQL data-stores, raw-files). It mediates the users
interaction with files, data structures, and databases, optimizing and
translating the query as appropriate to provide a smooth and
interactive session. It allows the data scientists and analyst to
write their queries in a unified way that does not have to change
because the data is stored in another format or a different
data-store. [@www-blaze]
