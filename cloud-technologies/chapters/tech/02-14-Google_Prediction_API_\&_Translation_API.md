Google Prediction API \& Translation API are part of Cloud ML API
family with specific roles. Below is a description of each and their
use.

Google Prediction API provides pattern-matching and machine learning
capabilities. Built on HTTP and JSON, the prediction API uses training
data to learn and consecutively use what has been learned to predict a
numeric value or choose a category that describes new pieces of
data. This makes it easier for any standard HTTP client to send
requests to it and parse the responses. The API can be used to predict
what users might like, categorize emails as spam or non-spam, assess
whether posted comments sentiments are positive or negative or how
much a user may spend in a day. Prediction API has a 6 month limited
free trial or a paid use for \$10 per project which offers up to
10,000 predictions a day [@www-prediction].

Google Translation API is a simple programmatic interface for
translating an arbitrary string into any supported language. Google
Translation API is highly responsive allowing websites and
applications to integrate for fast dynamic translation of source text
from source language to a target language. Translation API also
automatically identifies and translate languages with a high accuracy
from over a hundred different languages.  Google Translation API is
charged at \$20 per million characters making it an affordable
localization solution. Translation API is also distributed in two
editions, premium edition which is tailored for users with precise
long-form translation services like livestream, high volumes of emails
or detailed articles and documents. There's also standard edition
which is tailored for short, real-time conversations
[@www-translation].
