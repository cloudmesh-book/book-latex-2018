The Apache DataFu project was created out of the need for stable,
well-tested libraries for large scale data processing in Hadoop.
Apache DatFu consists of two libraries Apache DataFu Pig and Apache
DataFu Hourglass [@www-DataFu]. Apache DataFu Pig is a collection
of useful user-defined functions for data analysis in Apache Pig. The
functions are in areas of Statistics, Bag Operations, Set Operations,
Sessions, Sampling, Estimation, Hashing and Link Analysis.  Apache
DataFu Hourglass is a library for incrementally processing data using
Hadoop MapReduce. It is designed to make computations over sliding
windows more efficient. For these types of computations, the input
data is partitioned in some way, usually according to time, and the
range of input data to process is adjusted as new data arrives.
Hourglass works with input data that is partitioned by day, as this is
a common scheme for partitioning temporal data.
