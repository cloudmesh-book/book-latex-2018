It is an acronym for Kernel-based Virtual Machine for the Linux Kernel
that turns it into a hypervisor upon installation. It was originally
developed by Qumranet in 2007 [@www-KVM-wiki]. It has a kernel
model and uses kernel as VMM. It only supports fully virtualized
VMs. It is very active for Linux users due to it's ease of use, it can
be completely controlled by ourselves and there is an ease for
migration from or to other platforms. It is built to run on a x86
machine on an Intel processor with virtualization technology
extensions (VT-x) or an AMD-V. It supports 32 and 64 bit guests on a
64 bit host and hardware visualization features. The supported guest
systems are Solaris, Linux, Windows and BSD
Unix [@www-KVM-webpage].
