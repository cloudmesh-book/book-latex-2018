Apache Whirr is a set of libraries for running cloud services, which
provides a cloud-neutral way to run
services [@www-ApacheWhirr]. This is achieved by using
cloud-neutral provisioning and storage libraries such as jclouds and
libcloud. Whirr's API should be built on top these libraries and is
not exposed to the users. It is also a common service API, in which
the details of its working are, particular to the service.  Whirr
provides smart defaults for services by which any properly configured
system can run quickly, while still being able to override settings as
needed. Whirr can also be used as a command line tool for deploying
clusters. It uses low level API libraries to work with providers which
was mentioned in the [@www-slideshare-ApacheWhirr].
