R, a GNU project, is a successor to S - a statistical programming
language. It offers a range of capabilities - ``programming language,
high level graphics, interfaces to other languages and
debugging''. ``R is an integrated suite of software facilities for
data manipulation, calculation and graphical display''. The
statistical and graphical techniques provided by R make it popular in
the statistical community. The statistical techniques provided include
linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests,
time-series analysis, classification and clustering to name a
few [@www-R]. The number of packages available in R has made it
popular for use in machine learning, visualization, and data
operations tasks like data extraction, cleaning, loading,
transformation, analysis, modeling and visualization. It's strength
lies in analyzing data using its rich library but falls short when
working with very large datasets [@book-R].
