Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) markets its cloud products under the
\textit{Azure} brand name. At its most basic, Azure acts as an
\textit{infrastructure- as-a-service} (IaaS) provider.  IaaS virtualizes
hardware components, a key differentiation from other \textit{-as-a-service}
products. IaaS

> ``abstracts the user from the details of infrastructure like
> physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling,
> security, backup, etc'' [@www-wikipedia-cloud].

However, Azure offers a host of closely-related tool and products to
enhance and improve the core product, such as raw block storage, load
balancers, and IP addresses [@www-azure-msft]. For instance, Azure
users can access predictive analytics, Bots and
Blockchain-as-a-Service as well as more-basic computing, networking,
storage, database and management
components [@www-sec-edgar-msft] [@www-azure-msft].  The Azure
website shows twelve major categories under \textit{Products} and twenty
\textit{Solution} categories, e.g., e-commerce or Business SaaS apps.

Azure competes against Amazon's \textit{Amazon Web Service}, even though IBM
(\textit{SoftLayer} and \textit{Bluemix}) and Google (\textit{Google Cloud Platform})
offer IaaS to the market [@www-aws-amzn, www-softlayer-ibm,
  www-bluemix-ibm,www-cloud-google].  As of January 2017, Azure's
datacenters span 32 Microsoft-defined \textit{regions}, or 38 \textit{declared
regions}, throughout the world [@www-azure-msft].
