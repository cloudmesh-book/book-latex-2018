Fiddler is an HTTP debugging proxy server application. Fiddler
captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic and logs it for the user to review by
implementing man-in-the-middle interception using self-signed
certificates. Fiddler can also be used to modify (fiddle with) HTTP
traffic for troubleshooting purposes as it is being sent or
received.[5] By default, traffic from Microsoft's WinINET HTTP (S)
stack is automatically directed to the proxy at runtime, but any
browser or Web application (and most mobile devices) can be configured
to route its traffic through Fiddler [@www-fiddler].
