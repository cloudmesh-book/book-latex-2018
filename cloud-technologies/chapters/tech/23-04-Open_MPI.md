The Open MPI Project [@www-open-mpi] is an open source Message
Passing Interface implementation that is developed and maintained by a
consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open MPI is
therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources
from all across the High Performance Computing community in order to
build the best MPI library available. Open MPI offers advantages for
system and software vendors, application developers and computer
science researchers. Open MPI [@open-mpi-paper-2004] provides
functionality that has not previously been available in any single,
production-quality MPI implementation, including support for all of
MPI-2, multiple concurrent user threads, and multiple options for
handling process and network failures.
