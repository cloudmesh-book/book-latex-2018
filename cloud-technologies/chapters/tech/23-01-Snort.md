 [@www-snort] Snort is a Network Intrusion Prevention System
(NIPS) and Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Snort's open
source network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) has the ability
to perform real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on Internet
Protocol (IP) networks. Snort performs protocol analysis, content
searching and matching. These basic services have many purposes
including application-aware triggered quality of service, to
de-prioritize bulk traffic when latency-sensitive applications are in
use.  The program can also be used to detect probes or attacks,
including, but not limited to, operating system fingerprinting
attempts, common gateway interface, buffer overflows, server message
block probes, and stealth port scans.  Snort can be configured in
three main modes: sniffer, packet logger, and network intrusion
detection. In sniffer mode, the program will read network packets and
display them on the console. In packet logger mode, the program will
log packets to the disk. In intrusion detection mode, the program will
monitor network traffic and analyze it against a rule set defined by
the user. The program will then perform a specific action based on
what has been identified.
