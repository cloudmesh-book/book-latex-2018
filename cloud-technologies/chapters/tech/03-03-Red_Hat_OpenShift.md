OpenShift was launched as a PaaS (Platform as a Service) by Red Hat in
the Red Hat Summit, 2011 [@www-paas-openshift].  It is a cloud
application development and hosting platform that envisages shifting
of the developer's focus to development by automating the management
and scaling of applications [@www-developers-openshift].  Thus,
OpenShift enables us to write our applications in any one web
development language (using any framework) and it itself takes up the
task of running the application on the web\cite{www-openshift}.  This
has its advantages and disadvantages - advantage being the developer
doesn't have to worry about how the stuff works internally (as it is
abstracted away) and the disadvantage being that he cannot control how
it works, again because it is abstracted.

OpenShift is powered by Origin, which is in turn built using Docker
container packaging and Kubernetes container
cluster [@www-openshift-blog].  Due to this, OpenShift offers a
lot of options, including online, on-premise and open source project
options.
