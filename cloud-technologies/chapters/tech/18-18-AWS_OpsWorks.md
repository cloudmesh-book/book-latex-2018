AWS Opsworks is a configuration service provided by Amazon Web
Services that uses Chef, a Ruby and Erlang based configuration
management tool [@www-wikichef], to automate the configuration,
deployment, and management of servers and applications. There are two
versions of AWS Opsworks.  The first, a fee based offering called AWS
OpsWorks for Chef Automate, provides a Chef Server and suite of tools
to enable full stack automation. The second, AWS OpsWorks Stacks, is a
free offering in which applications are modeled as stacks containing
various layers. Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances or other
resources can be deployed and configured in each layer of AWS OpsWorks
Stacks [@www-awsopsworks].
