Oozie is a workflow manager and scheduler. Oozie is designed to scale
in a Hadoop cluster. Each job will be launched from a different
datanode [@paper-Oozie] [@www-Oozie1]. Oozie is architected
from the ground up for large-scale Hadoop workflow [@www-Oozie2].
Scales to meet the demand, provides a multi-tenant service, is secure
to protect data and processing, and can be operated cost effective
ly. As demand for workflow and the sophistication of applications
increase, it must continue to mature in these areas
\cite{paper-Oozie}.Is well integrated with Hadoop security. Is the
only workflow manager with built-in Hadoop actions, making workflow
development, maintenance and troubleshooting easier. It's UI makes it
easier to drill down to specific errors in the data nodes. Proven to
scale in some of the world's largest clusters [@paper-Oozie]. Gets
callbacks from MapReduce jobs so it knows when they finish and whether
they hang without expensive polling. Oozie Coordinat or allows
triggering actions when files arrive at HDFS. Also supported by Hadoop
vendors [@paper-Oozie].
