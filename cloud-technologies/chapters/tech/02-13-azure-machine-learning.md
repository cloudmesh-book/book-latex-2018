Azure Machine Learning is a cloud based service that can be used to do
predictive analytics, machine learning or data mining. It has features
like in-built algorithm library, machine learning studio and a web
service [@www-azureMLSite]. In built algorithm library has
implementation of various popular machine learning algorithms like
decision tree, SVM, linear regression, neural networks etc. Machine
learning studio facilitates creation of predictive models using
graphical user interface by dragging, dropping and connecting of
different modules that can be used by people with minimal knowledge in
the machine learning field. Machine learning studio is a free service
for basic version and comes with a monthly charge for advanced
versions. Apart from building models, studio also has options to do
preprocessing like clean, transform and normalize the data. Webservice
provides option to deploy the machine learning algorithm as ready to
consume APIs that can be reused in future with minimal effort and can
also be published.
