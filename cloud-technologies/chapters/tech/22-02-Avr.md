Apache Avro is a data serialization system, which provides rich data
structures, remote procedure call (RPC), a container file to store
persistent data and simple integration with dynamic
languages [@www-Avro].  Avro depends on schemas, which are defined
with JSON. This facilitates implementation in other languages that
have the JSON libraries.  The key advantages of Avro are schema
evolution - Avro will handle the missing/extra/modified fields,
dynamic typing - serialization and deserialization without code
generation, untagged data - data encoding and faster data processing
by allowing data to be written without overhead.
