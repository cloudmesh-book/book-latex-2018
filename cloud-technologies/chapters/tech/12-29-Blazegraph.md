Blazegraph is a graph database also supporting property graph, capable
of clustered deployment. A graph database is a NoSQL database. It is
based on a graph theory of nodes and edges where each node represents
an element such as user or business and each edge represents
relationship between two nodes. It is mainly used for storing and
analyzing data where maintaining interconnections is essential. Data
pertaining to social media is best example where graph database can be
used.

Blazegraph's main focus is large scale complex graph analytics and
query.  The Blazegraph database runs on graphics processing units
(GPU) to speed graph traversals. [@paper-blzgraph]

Lets now see how Blazegraph handles data. [@www-blzgraph] {\bf
Blazegraph data can be accessed} using REST APIs.

{\bf Blazegraph supports} Apache TinkerPop, which is a graph computing
 framework.

{\bf For graph data mining,} Blazegraph implements GAS (Gather, Apply,
Scatter) model as a service.
