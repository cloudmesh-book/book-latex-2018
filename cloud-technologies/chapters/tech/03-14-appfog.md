AppFog can be decribed as ``a platform as a service (PaaS)
provider'' [@wee]. Platform as a service provides a platform for
the development of web applications without the necessity of
purchasing the software and infrastructure that supports
it [@kepes]. PaaS provides an environment for the creation of
software [@kepes]. The underlying support infrastructure that
AppFog provides includes things such as runtime, middleware, o/s,
virtualization, servers, storage, and networking [@appfog]. AppFog
is based on VMWare's CloudFoundry project [@wee]. It gets things
such as MySQL, Mongo, Reddis, memCache, etc. running and then manages
them [@tweney].
