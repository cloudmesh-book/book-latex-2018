Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is an open standard application
programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems
(DBMS) [@www-odbc]. ODBC was developed by the SQL Access Group and
released in September, 1992. Microsoft Windows was the first to
provide an ODBC product. Later the versions for UNIX, OS/2, and
Macintosh platforms were developed. ODBC is independent of the
programming language, database system and platform.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a API developed specific to the
Java programming language. JDBC was released as part of Java
Development Kit (JDK) 1.1 on February 19, 1997 by Sun
Microsystems [@www-jdbc]. The 'java.sql' and 'javax.sql' packages
contain the JDBC classes. JDBC is more suitable for object oriented
databases. JDBC can be used for ODBC compliant databases by using a
JDBC-to-ODBC bridge.
