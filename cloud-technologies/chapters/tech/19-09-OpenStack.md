OpenStack [@www-OpenStack.org] is a free and open source cloud
operating system mostly deployed as infrastructure as a service (Iaas)
that allows us to control large pool of computers, storage, and
networking resources.  OpenStack is managed by OpenStack Foundation
\cite{www-OpenStack-Found}.
     
Just like cloud, OpenStack provides infrastructure which runs as
platform upon which end users can create applications. Key components
of OpenStack include: Nova: which is the primary computing engine,
Swift: which is a storage system for object and files, Neutron: which
ensures effective communication between each of the components of the
OpenStack. Other components include: Cinder, Horizon, Keystone,
Glance, Ceilometer and Heat. The main goal of Openstack is to allow
business to build Amazon-like cloud services in their own data
centers.OpenStack is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license
