Pegasus is workflow management system that allows to compose and
execute a workflow in an application in different environment without
the need for any modifications [@www-Pegasus]. It allows users to
make high level workflow without thinking about the low level
details. It locates the required input data and computational
resources automatically.  Pegasus also maintains information about
tasks done and data produced. In case of errors Pegasus tries to
recover by retrying the whole workflow and providing check pointing at
workflow-level.  It cleans up the storage as the workflow gets
executed so that data-intensive workflows can have enough required
space to execute on storage-constrained resources. Some of the other
advantages of Pegasus are:scalability, reliability and high
performance. Pegasus has been used in many scientific domains like
astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, ocean science,
gravitational wave physics and others.
