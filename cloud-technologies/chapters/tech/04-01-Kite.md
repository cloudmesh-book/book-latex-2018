Kite is a programming language designed to minimize the required
experience level of the programmer.  It aims to allow quick
development and running time and low CPU and memory usage. Kite was
designed with lightweight systems in mind.  On OS X Leopard, the main
Kite library is only 88KB, with each package in the standard library
weighing in at 13-30KB. The main design philosophy is minimalism -
only include the minimum necessary, while giving developers the power
to write anything that they can write in other languages. Kite
combines both object oriented and functional paradigms in the language
syntax.  One special feature is its use of the pipe character (|) to
indicate function calls, as opposed to the period (.) or arrow (->) in
other languages.  Properties are still de-referenced using the
period [@kite-devtopics]. Kite also offers a digital assistant for
programmers. Kite offers a product which sits as a sidebar in code
editor and enables programmers to search for opensource codes to
implement in their codes. It even provides relavant examples/syntax
and also tries to spot errors in the programs [@kite-wired].
