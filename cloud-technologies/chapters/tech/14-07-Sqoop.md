Apache Sqoop is a tool to transfer large amounts of data between
Apache Hadoop and sql databases [@www-sqoop]. The name is a
Portmanteau of SQL + Hadoop. It is a command line interface
application which supports incremental loads of complete tables, free
form (custom) SQL Queries and allows the use of saved and scheduled
jobs to import latest updates made since the last import. The imports
can also be used to populate tables in Hive or Hbase. Sqoop has the
option of export, which allows data to be transferred from Hadoop into
a relational database. Sqoop is supported in many different business
integration suits like Informatica Big Data Management, Pentaho Data
Integration, Microsoft BI Suite and Couchbase [@sqoop-wiki].
