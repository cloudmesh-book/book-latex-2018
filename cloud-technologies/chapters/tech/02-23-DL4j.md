DL4j stands for Deeplearning4j [@www-dl4j]. It is a deep learning
programming library written for Java and the Java virtual machine
(JVM) and a computing framework with wide support for deep learning
algorithms. Deeplearning4j includes implementations of the restricted
Boltzmann machine, deep belief net, deep autoencoder, stacked
denoising autoencoder and recursive neural tensor network, word2vec,
doc2vec, and GloVe. These algorithms all include distributed parallel
versions that integrate with Apache Hadoop and Spark. It is a
open-source software released under Apache License 2.0.

Training with Deeplearning4j occurs in a cluster. Neural nets are
trained in parallel via iterative reduce, which works on Hadoop-YARN
and on Spark. Deeplearning4j also integrates with CUDA kernels to
conduct pure GPU operations, and works with distributed GPUs.
