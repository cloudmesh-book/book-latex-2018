Google BigQuery is an enterprise data warehouse used for large scale
data analytics [@www-bigquery-documentation] [@www-bigquery].
A user can store and query massive datasets by storing the data in
BigQuery and querying the database using fast SQL queries using the
processing power of Google's infrastructure. In Google BigQuery a user
can control access to both the project and the data based on the his
business needs which gives the ability to others to view and even
query the data [@www-bigquery]. BigQuery can scale the database
from GigaBytes to PetaBytes. BigQuery can be accessed using a Web UI
or a command-line tool or even by making calls to the BigQuery REST
API using a variety of client libraries such as Java, .NET pr
python. BigQuery can also be accessed using a variety of third party
tool. BigQuery is fully managed to get started on its own, so there is
no need to deploy any resources such as disks and virtual machines.

Projects in BigQuery are top-level containers in Google Cloud
Platform\cite{www-bigquery-documentation}. They contain the BigQuery
Data. Each project is referenced by a name and unique ID. Tables
contain the data in BigQuery. Each table has a schema that describes
field names, types, and other information. Datasets enable to organise
and control access to the tables. Every table must belong to a
dataset. A BigQuery data can be shared with others by defining roles
and setting permissions for organizations, projects, and datasets, but
not on the tables within them. BigQuery stores data in the Capacitor
columnar datacformat, and offers the standard database concepts of
tables, partitions, columns, and
rows [@www-bigquery-columnar-storage].
