Google App Engine is a cloud computing platform to host your mobile or
web applications on Google managed servers. Google App Engine provides
automatic scaling for web applications, i.e it automatically allocates
more resources to the application upon increase in the number of
requests. It gives developers the freedom to focus on developing their
code and not worry about the infrastructure. Google App Engine
provides built-in services and APIs such as load balancing, automated
security scanning, application logging, NoSQL datastores, memcache,
and a user authentication API, that are a core part to most
applications [@www-appengine-google].
     
An App Engine platform can be run in either the Standard or the
Flexible environment. Standard environment lays restrictions on the
maximum number of resources an application can use and charges a user
based on the instance hours used. The flexible environment as the name
suggests provides higher flexibility in terms of resources and is
charged based on the CPU and disk utilization.The App Engine requires
developers to use only its supported languages and
frameworks. Supported languages are Java, Python, Ruby, Scala, PHP,
GO, Node.js and other JVM oriented languages. The App Engine datastore
uses a SQL like syntax called the GQL (Google Query Language) which
works with non-relational databases when compared to
SQL [@www-wiki-appengine].
