Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time
pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically unify data from
disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your
choice [@www-logstash]. Cleanse and democratize all your data for
diverse advanced downstream analytics and visualization use cases.

While Logstash originally drove innovation in log collection, its
capabilities extend well beyond that use case. Any type of event can
be enriched and transformed with a broad array of input, filter, and
output plugins, with many native codecs further simplifying the
ingestion process. Logstash accelerates your insights by harnessing a
greater volume and variety of data.
