Portable Batch System (or simply PBS) is the name of computer software
that performs job scheduling. Its primary task is to allocate
computational tasks, i.e., batch jobs, among the available computing
resources. It is often used in conjunction with UNIX cluster
environments [@openpbs-wiki]. OpenPBS is the original open source
version of PBS. There are more commercialized versions of the same
software. One of the key feature of OpenPBS is that it supports
millions of cores with fast job dispatch and minimal latency. It meets
unique site goals and SLAs by balancing job turnaround time and
utilization with optimal job placement. OpenPBS also includes
automatic fail-over architecture with no single point of failure -
jobs are never lost, and jobs continue to run despite failures. It is
built upon a Flexible Plugin Framework which simplifies administration
with enhanced visibility and extensibility [@openpbs-www].
