Sun Grid Engine (SGE) renamed to Oracle Grid Engine (OGE) is a grid
computing cluster software system [@www-sge-wiki]. Grid Engine is
a high performance computing cluster used for managing job queueing in
distributed and parallel environment. It can accept, schedule,
dispatch and manage the execution of single, parallel user jobs in a
remote or distributed manner. It also manages the resource allocation
to those jobs. The resources can be anything like processors, storage,
RAM and licenses for softwares. The latest stable release of OGE is
termed as 6.2u8 which came out in October 1,2012.

OGE supports a vast array of features like: Topology-aware scheduling
and thread binding, advanced fault tolerance mechanisms for job
scheduling, web interface based status reporting and ability to use
different scheduling algorithms,etc. OGE runs on several platforms
including AIX, BSD, Linux, Solaris, OS X, Tru64, Windows, etc. It is
under deployment phase for IBM's 64-bit operating system
z/OS. Standard Grid cluster comprises of one master host and many
execution hosts. There is a option of creating shadow master hosts
which would take the master's place incase of a system crash. Notable
deployments of OGE include: TSUBAME supercomputer at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology,Ranger at the Texas Advanced Computing Center
(TACC) and San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC).
