The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit - CNTK - is a unified deep-learning
toolkit by Microsoft Research. It is in essence an implementation of
Computational Network (CN) which supports both CPU and GPU. CNTK
supports arbitrary valid computational networks and makes building
DNNs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMS, and other complicated networks as simple as
describing the operations of the networks.  The toolkit is implemented
with efficiency in mind. It removes duplicate computations in both
forward and backward passes, uses minimal memory needed and reduces
memory reallocation by reusing them. It also speeds up the model
training and evaluation by doing batch computation whenever
possible [@book-cntk]. It can be included as a library in your
Python or C++ pro grams, or used as a standalone machine learning tool
through its own model description language
(BrainScript) [@www-cntk]. Latest Version:2017-02-10. V 2.0 Beta
11 Release
