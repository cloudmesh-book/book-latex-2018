GraphLab is a graph-based, distributed computation, high performance
framework for machine learning written in C++ [@www-graphlab]. It
is an open source project started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie
Mellon University in 2009, designed considering the scale, variety and
complexity of real world data. It integrates various high level
algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Descent \&
Locking and provides high performance experience. It includes scalable
machine learning toolkits which has implementation for deep learning,
factor machines, topic modeling, clustering, nearest neighbors and
almost everything required to enhance machine learning models. This
framework is targeted for sparse iterative graph algorithms. It helps
data scientists and developers easily create and install applications
at large scale.
