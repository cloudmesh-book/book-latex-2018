Potree is a opensource tool powered by WebGL based viewer to visualize
data from large point clouds [@www-potree].  It started at the TU
Wien, institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms and currently
begin continued under the Harvest4D project. Potree relies on
reorganizing the point cloud data into an multi-resolution octree data
structure which is time consuming. It efficiency can be improved by
using techniques such as divide and conquer as discussed in a
conference paper Taming the beast: Free and Open Source massive cloud
point cloud web visualization [@potree-paper-1]. It has also been
widely used in works involving spatio-temporal data where the changes
in geographical features are across time [@potree-paper-2].
