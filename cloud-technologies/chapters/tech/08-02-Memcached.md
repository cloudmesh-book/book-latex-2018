Memcached is a free and open-source, high performance, distributed
memory object caching system [@www-memcached].  Although,
generic in nature,it is intended for se in speeding up dynamic web
applications by reducing the database load.

It can be thought of as a short term memory for your applications.
Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of
arbitrary data from the results of database calls, API calls and page
rendering. Its API is available in most of the popular languages. In
simple terms, it allows you to take memory from parts of your system
where you have more memory than you need and allocate it to parts of
your system where you have less memory than you need.
