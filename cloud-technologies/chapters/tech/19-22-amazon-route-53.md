Amazon Route 53 is a DNS (Domain Name System) service that gives
developers and businesses a reliable way to route end users to
Internet applications. The number 53 refers to TCP or UDP port 53,
where DNS server requests are addressed [@www-ar53].
     
When using Route 53 as your DNS provider, in case of a recursion, the
query of fetching an IP address (of a website or application) always
goes to the closest server location to reduce query latency. The Route
53 server returns the IP address enabling the browser to load the
website or application. Route 53 can also be used for registering
domain names and arranging DNS health checks to monitor the
server [@www-amar53].
