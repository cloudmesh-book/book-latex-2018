MLlib is Apache Spark's scalable machine learning
library [@www-mllib]. Its goal is to make machine learning
scalable and easy. MLlib provides various tools such as, algorithms,
feature extraction, utilities for data handling and tools for
constructing, evaluating, and tuning machine learning pipelines. MLlib
uses the linear algebra package Breeze, which depends on netlib-java
for optimized numerical processing. MLlib is shipped with Spark and
supports several languages which provides functionality for wide range
of learning settings. MLlib library includes Java, Scala and Python
APIs and is released as a part of Spark project under the Apache 2.0
license [@MLlib-article].
