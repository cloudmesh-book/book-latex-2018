Graylog is an open source log management tool that allows an
organization to assemble, organize and analyze large amounts of data
from its network activity. It collects and aggregates events from a
group of sources and presents data in a streamlines, simplified
interface where one can drill down to significant metrics, identify
key relationships, generate powerful data visualizations and derive
actionable insights [@www-graylog-blog].  Graylog allows us to
centrally collect and manage log messages of an organization's
complete infrastructure [@www-graylog-optimization]. A user can
perform search on terrabytes of log data to discover number of failed
logins,find application errors across all servers or monitor the
acivity of a suspicious user id.Graylog works on top of ElasticSearch
and MongoDB to facilitate this high availability searching.  Graylog
provides visualization through creation of dashboards that allows a
user to build pre-defined views on his data to assemble all of his
important data only a single click away
[@www-graylog-dashboards]. Any search result or metric shall be
added as a widget on the dashboard to observe trends in one single
location. These dashboards can also be shared with other users in the
organization. Based on a user's recent search queries,graylog also
allows you to distinguish data that are not searched upon very often
and thus can be archived on cost effective storage drives. Users can
also add certain trigger conditions that shall alert the system about
performance issues, failed logins or exceptions in the flow of the
application.
