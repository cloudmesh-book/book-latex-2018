Infinispan is a highly available, extremely scalable key/value data
store and data grid platform. The design perspective of infinispan is
exposing a distributed,highly concurrent data structure to make the
most use of modern multi-core as well as multi-processor
architectures. It is mostly used as a distributed cache, but also can
be used as a object database or NoSQL key/value
store [@infinispan.org].

Infinispan is mostly used as a cache store. It is predominantly used
for applications that are clustered, and requires a cache coherency
for data consistency. Infinispan is written in java and is open
source. It is fully transactional. Infinispan is used to add
clusterability as well as high availability to frameworks.  Infinispan
has many use-cases,they are: (1) it can be used as a distributed cache
(2) Storage for temporal data, like web sessions, (3) Cross-JVM
communication, (4) Shared storage, (5) In-memory data processing and
analytics and (6) MapReduce Implementstion in the In-Memory Data
Grid. It is also used in research and academia as a framework for
distribution execution and storage [@infinispan_wikipedia].
