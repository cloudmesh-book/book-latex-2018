Azure Event Hubs is a hyper-scale telemetry ingestion service. It
collects, transforms, and stores millions of events. As a distributed
streaming platform, it offers low latency and configurable time
retention enabling one to ingress massive amounts of telemetry into
the cloud and read the data from multiple applications using
publish-subscribe semantics [@www-eventhubs]. It is a highly
scalable data streaming platform. Data sent to an Event Hub can be
transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or
batching/storage adapters. With the ability to provide
publish-subscribe capabilities, Event Hubs serves as the *on ramp*
for Big Data.
