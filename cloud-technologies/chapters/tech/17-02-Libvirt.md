Libvirt is an open source API to manage hardware virtualization
developed by Red Hat.  It is a standard C library but has
accessibility from other languages such as Python, Perl, Java and
others [@www-libvirt]. Multiple virtual machine monitors (VMM) or
hypervisors are supported such as KVM,QEMU, Xen, Virtuozzo, VMWare
ESX, LXC, and BHyve.  It can be divided into five categories such as
hypervisor connection, domain, network, storage volume and
pool [@www-ibm]. It is accessible by many operating systems such
as Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS, and Windows OS.
