RabbitMQ is a message broker which allows services to exchange
messages in a fault tolerant manner [@www-rabbitmq].  It provides
variety of features which ``enables software applications to connect
and scale''. Features are: reliability, flexible routing, clustering,
federation, highly available queues, multi-protocol, many clients,
management UI, tracing, plugin system, commercial support, large
community and user base. RabbitMQ can work in multiple scenarios:

     1. Simple messaging: producers write messages to the queue and
        consumers read messages from the queue. This is synonymous
        to a simple message queue.

     2. Producer-consumer: Producers produce messages and consumers
        receive messages from the queue. The messages are delivered to
        multiple consumers in round robin manner.

     3. Publish-subscribe: Producers publish messages to exchanges
        and consumers subscribe to these exchanges. Consumers receive
        those messages when the messages are available in those
        exchanges.

     4. Routing: In this mode consumers can subscribe to a subset
        of messages instead of receiving all messages from the queue.

     5. Topics: Producers can produce messages to a topic multiple
        consumers registered to receive messages from those topics get
        those messages. These topics can be handled by a single
        exchange or multiple exchanges.

     6. RPC:In this mode the client sends messages as well as
        registers a callback message queue. The consumers consume the
        message and post the response message to the callback queue.

        RabbitMQ is based on AMPQ (Advanced
        Message Queuing Protocol) messaging model\cite{ampq-article}.
        AMPQ is described
        as follows ``messages are published to exchanges, which are
        often compared to post offices or mailboxes. Exchanges then
        distribute message copies to queues using rules called
        bindings. Then AMQP brokers either deliver messages to
        consumers subscribed to queues, or consumers fetch/pull
        messages from queues on demand''
