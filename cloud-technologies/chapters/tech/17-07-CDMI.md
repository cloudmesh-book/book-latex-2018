various standards to ensure the quality and interoperability of
various storage systems. One of the standards defined by SNIA to for
providers and users of cloud is Cloud Data Management Interface
(CDMI). According latest issue of CDMI, ``CDMI International Standard
is intended for application developers who are implementing or using
cloud storage [@cdmi-manual]. It documents how to access cloud
storage and to manage the data stored there.'' It defines functional
interface for applications that will use cloud for various
functionalities like create, retrieve, update and delete data elements
from the cloud. These interface could be used to manage containers
along with the data. The interface could be used by administrative and
management applications as well. Also, the CDMI specification uses
RESTful principles in the interface design. All the standards issued
