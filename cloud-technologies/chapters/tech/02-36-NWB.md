NWB stands for Network workbench is analysis, modelling and
visualization toolkit for the network scientists.  It provides an
environment which help scientist researchers and practitioner to get
online access to the shared resource environment and network datasets
for analysis, modelling and visualization of large scale networking
application.  User can access this network datasets and algorithms
previously obtained by doing lot of research and can also add their
own datasets helps in speeding up the process and saving the time for
redoing the same analysis [@www-nwb.edu].

NWB provides advanced tools for users to understand and interact with
different types of networks.  NWB members are largely the computer
scientist, biologist, engineers, social and behavioral scientist. The
platform helps the specialist researchers to transfer the knowledge
within the broader scientific and research communities.
