REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework) is a scale-out
computing fabric that eases the development of Big Data applications
on top of resource managers such as Apache YARN and
Mesos [@www-reef]. It is a Big Data system that makes it easy to
implement scalable, fault-tolerant runtime environments for a range of
data processing models on top of resource managers. REEF provides
capabilities to run multiple heterogeneous frameworks and workflows of
those efficiently. REEF contains two libraries, Wake and Tang where
Wake is an event-based-programming framework inspired by Rx and SEDA
and Tang is a dependency injection framework inspired by Google Guice,
but designed specifically for configuring distributed systems.
