ImageJ is a Java-based image processing program developed at the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). ImageJ was designed with an open
architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins and
recordable macros.  Using ImageJ's built-in editor and a Java
compiler, it has enabled to solve many image processing and analysis
problems in scientific research from three-dimensional live-cell
imaging to radiological image processing.  ImageJ's plugin
architecture and built-in development environment has made it a
popular platform for teaching image processing [@www-imagej].
