DataNucleus (available under Apache 2 open source license) is a data
management framework in Java. Formerly known as 'Java Persistent
Objects' (JPOX) this was relaunched in 2008 as
'DataNucleus'. DataNucleus Access Platform is a fully compliant
implementation of the Java Persistent API (JPA) and Java Data Objects
(JDO) specifications [@www-DataNucleusWiki]. It provides
persistence and retrieval of data to a number of datastores using a
number of APIs, with a number of query languages. In addition to
object-relational mapping (ORM) it can also map and manage data from
sources other than RDBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQLServer, DB2,
H2 etc.) such as Map-based (Cassandra, HBase), Graph-based (Neo4j),
Documents (XLS, OOXML, XML, ODF), Web-based (Amazon S3, Google
Storage, JSON), Doc-based (MongoDB) and Others (NeoDatis, LDAP). It
supports the JPA (Uses JPQL Query language), JDO (Uses JDOQL Query
language) and REST APIs [@www-DataNucleus].DataNucleus products
are built from a sequence of plugins where each of it is an OSGi
bundle and can be used in an OSGi environment. Google App Engine uses
DataNucleus as the Java persistence
layer [@www-DataNucleusPerformance].
