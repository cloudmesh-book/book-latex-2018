Cloudbees provides Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution, which is a
cloud service for Java applications [@www-cloudbees-wiki]. It is
used to build, run and manage the web applications. It was created in
2010 by Jenkins. It has a continuous delivery platform for DevOps, and
adds a enterprise-grade functionality with an expert level
support. Cloudbees is better than the traditional Java platform as it
requires no provision of the nodes, clusters, load balancers and
databases. In cloudbees the environment is constantly managed and
monitored where a metering and scale updating is done on a real time
basis. The platform ships with verified security and enhancements
assuring less risk for sharing sensitive information. It implies the
task of getting the platform accessed by every user using the feature
\textit{Jenkins Sprawl} [@www-cloudbees-webpage].
