Presto is an open-source distributed SQL query engine that supports
interactive analytics on large datasets [@www-presto]. It allows
interfacing with a variety of data sources such as Hive, Cassandra,
RDBMSs and proprietary data source. Presto is used at a number of
big-data companies such as Facebook, Airbnb and Dropbox. Presto's
performance compares favorably to similar systems such as Hive and
Stinger [@presto-paper-2014].
