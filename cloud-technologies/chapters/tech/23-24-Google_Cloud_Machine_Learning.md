Google Could Machi<ne Leaning is a Googles cloud based managed system
for building machine learning model, capable to work on any type and
volume of data. User can create their own machine learning model using
GoogleTensorFlow framework, which helps to use the range of Google
products from Google Photos to Google Cloud Speech.  We can build our
machine learning model regardless the size, google will managed it
infrastructure according to requirement. User can immediately host the
created model and start predicting on new
data [@www-googlecloudmachinelearning].Cloud Machine Learning
provides two important things:
     
* Help user to train the machine learning model at large scale
  with the help of TensorFlow  training application.
  
* User can host the trained model on cloud,  this will help
  to use the large and new data available on cloud, which help in
  creating good model.

* Google CloudML will help user to focus on model instead of
  hardware configuration and resource
  management [@www-googlecloudoverview].
