Google Pub/Sub provides an asynchronous messaging facility which
assists the communication between independent applications
 [@www-google-pub-sub]. It works in real time and helps keep the
two interacting systems independent. It is the same technology used by
many of the Google apps like GMail, Ads, etc. and so integration with
them becomes very easy.  Some of the typical features it provides are:
(1) Push and Pull - Google Pub/Sub integrates quickly and easily with
the systems hosted on the Google Cloud Platform thereby supporting
one-to-many, one-to-one and many-to-many communication, using the push
and pull requests. (2) Scalability - It provides high scalability and
availability even under heavy load without any degradation of
latency. This is done by using a global and highly scalable
design. (3) Encryption - It provides security by encryption of the
stored data as well as that in transit. Other than these important
features, it provides some others as well, like the usage of RESTful
APIs, end-to-end acknowledgement, replicated storage,
etc [@www-google-pub-sub-features].
