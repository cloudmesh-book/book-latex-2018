MapReduce Query Language (MRQL, pronounced miracle) ``is a query
processing and optimization system for large-scale, distributed data
analysis'' [@www-apachemrql]. MRQL provides a SQL like language
for use on Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and Flink.  MRQL allows users
to perform complex data analysis using only SQL like queries, which
are translated by MRQL to efficient Java code. MRQL can evaluate
queries in Map-Reduce (using Hadoop), Bulk Synchronous Parallel (using
Hama), Spark, and Flink modes [@www-apachemrql].

MRQL was created in 2011 by Leaonids Fegaras and is currently in the
Apache Incubator [@www-mrqlhadoop].  All projects accepted by the
Apache Software Foundation (ASF) undergo an incubation period until a
review indicates that the project meets the standards of other ASF
projects [@www-apacheincubator].
