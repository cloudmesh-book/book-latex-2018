Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) is an open source
implementation of the WS-BPEL 2.0 standard. WS-BPEL which stands for
Web Services Business Process Execution Language, is an executable
language for writing business processes with web
services [@www-bpel-wiki].  It includes control structures like
conditions or loops as well as elements to invoke web services and
receive messages from services.  ODE uses WSDL (Web Services
Description Language) for interfacing with web
services [@www-ode-wiki]. Naming a few of its features, It
supports two communication layers for interacting with the outside
world, one based on Axis2 (Web Services http transport) and another
one based on the JBI standard. It also supports both long and short
living process executions for orchestrating services for
applications [@www-ode-web].
