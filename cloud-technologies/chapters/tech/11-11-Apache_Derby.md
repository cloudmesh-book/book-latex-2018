DB subproject and licensed under Apache version 2.0.

Derby Embedded Database Engine is the database engine with JDBC and
SQL as programming APIs.  Client/Server functionality is achieved by
Derby network server, it allows connection through TCP/IP using DRDA
protocol [@www-apachederbycharter]. ij, database utility makes it
possible for SQL scripts to be run on JDBC database. The dblook
utility is the schema extraction tool. The sysinfo utility is used for

There are two deployment options for Apache Derby, embedded and Derby
network server option. In embedded framework, Derby is started and
stopped by the single user java application without any administration
