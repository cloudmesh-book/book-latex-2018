The Globus Toolkit is an open source toolkit organized as a collection
of loosely coupled components [@sotomayor2006globus]. These
components consist of services, programming libraries and development
tools designed for building Grid-based applications. GT components
fall into five broad domain areas: Security, Data Management,
Execution Management, Information Services, and Common
Runtime [@foster2006globus]. These components enable a broader
\textit{Globus ecosystem} of tools and components that build on or
interoperate with GT functionality to provide a wide range of useful
application-level functions [@www-about-globus]. Since 2000,
companies like Fujitsu, IBM, NEC and Oracle have pursued Grid
strategies based on the Globus Toolkit [@www-about-globus].
