Splunk is a platform for big data analytics. It is a software product
that enables you to search, analyze, and visualize the
machine-generated data gathered from the websites, applications,
sensors, devices, and so on, that comprise your IT infrastructure or
business [@www-splunk]. After defining the data source, Splunk
indexes the data stream and parses it into a series of individual
events that you can view and search. It provides distributed search
and MapReduce linearly scales search and reporting. It uses a standard
API to connect directly to applications and devices. It was developed
in response to the demand for comprehensible and actionable data
reporting for executives outside a company's IT
department [@www-splunk].
