GridFTP is a enhancement on the File Tranfer Protocol (FTP) which
provides high-performance, secure and reliable data transfer for
high-bandwidth wide-area networks. The most widely used implementation
of GridFTP is Globus Online [@www-GlobusOnline]. GridFTP achieves
efficient use of bandwidth by using multiple simultaneous TCP streams.
Files can be downloaded in pieces simultaneously from multiple
sources; or even in separate parallel streams from the same
source. GridFTP allows transfers to be restarted automatically and
handles network unavailability with a fault tolerant implementation of
FTP.The underlying TCP connection in FTP has numerous settings such as
window size and buffer size. GridFTP allows automatic (or manual)
negotiation of these settings to provide optimal transfer speeds and
reliability.
