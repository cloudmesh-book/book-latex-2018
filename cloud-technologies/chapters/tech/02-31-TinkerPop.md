ThinkerPop is a graph computing framework from Apache software
foundation [@www-ApacheTinkerPop]. Before coming under the Apache
project, ThinkerPop was a stack of technologies like Blueprint, Pipes,
Frames, Rexters, Furnace and Gremlin where each part was supporting
graph-based application development. Now all parts are come under
single TinkerPop project repo [@www-news]. It uses Gremlin, a
graph traversal machine and language. It allows user to write complex
queries (traversal), that can use for real-time transactional (OLTP)
queries, graph analytic system (OLAP) or combination of both as in
hybrid. Gremlin is written in
java [@www-ApacheTinkerPopHome]. TinkerPop has an ability to
create a graph in any size or complexity. Gremlin engine allows user
to write graph traversal in Gremlin language, Python, JavaScript,
Scala, Go, SQL and SPARQL. It is capable to adhere with small graph
which requires a single machine or massive graphs that can only be
possible with large cluster of machines, without changing the code.
