Arvados Crunch is a containerized workflow engine for running complex,
multi-part pipelines or workflows in a way that is flexible, scalable,
and supports versioning, reproducibility, and provenance while running
in virtualized computing environments [@www-arvados]. The Arvados
Crunch framework is designed to support processing very large data
batches (gigabytes to terabytes)
efficiently [@www-crunch]. Arvados Crunch increases concurrency by
running tasks asynchronously, using many CPUs and network interfaces
at once (especially beneficial for CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks
respectively). Crunch also tracks inputs, outputs, and settings so you
can verify that the inputs, settings, and sequence of programs you
used to arrive at an output is really what you think it was. Crunch
ensures that your programs and workflows are repeatable with different
versions of your code, OS updates, etc. and allows you to interrupt
and resume long-running jobs consisting of many short tasks and
maintains timing statistics automatically.
