As the amount of data Facebook stores continues to increase, the need
for quick access and efficient storage of data continues to rise.
Facebook stores a class of data in Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs), which
can be created once, read many times, never modified, and sometimes
deleted. Haystack, Facebook's traditional BLOB storage system is
becoming increasingly inefficient. The storage efficiency is measured
in the effective-replication-factor of BLOBs.

f4 BLOB storage system provides an effective-replication-factor lower
than that of Haystack. f4 is simple, modular, scalable, and fault
tolerant. f4 currently stores over 65PBs of logical BLOBs, with a
reduced effective-replication-factor from 3.6 to either 2.8 or 2.1
[@paper-f4].
