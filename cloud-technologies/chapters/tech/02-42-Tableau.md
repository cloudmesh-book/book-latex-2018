Tableau is a family of interactive data visualization products focused
on business intelligence [@www-tableau-tutorial]. The different
products which tableau has built are: Tableau Desktop, for individual
use; Tableau Server for collaboration in an organization; Tableau
Online, for Business Intelligence in the Cloud; Tableau Reader, for
reading files saved in Tableau Desktop; Tableau Public, for
journalists or anyone to publish interactive data
online. [@www-tableau-web]. Tableau uses VizQL as a visual query
language for translating drag-and-drop actions into data queries and
later expressing the data visually. Tableau also benefits from an
Advanced In-Memory Technology for handling large amounts of data.  The
strengths of Tableau are mainly the ease of use and speed.  However,
it has a number of limitations, which the most prominent are unfitness
for broad business and technical user, being closed-source, no
predictive analytical capabilities and no support for expanded
analytics.
