Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming
language. It has been developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS,
tvOS, and Linux. This programming language is intended to be more
robust and resilient to erroneous code than Objective-C, and more
concise. It has been built with the LLVM compiler framework included
in Xcode 6 and later and, on platforms other than Linux. C,
Objective-C, C++ and Swift code can be run within one program as Swift
uses the Objective-C runtime library [@www-swift-wikipedia].

Swift supports the core concepts that made Objective-C flexible,
notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible
programming and similar features. Swift features have well-known
safety and performance trade-offs. A system that helps address common
programming errors like null pointers was introduced to enhance
safety. Apple has invested considerable effort in aggressive
optimization that can flatten out method calls and accessors to
eliminate this overhead to handle performance issues.
