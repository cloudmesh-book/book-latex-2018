Neo4J is a popular ACID compliant graph database management system
developed by Neo technology [@www-wiki-neo4j].  In this database
everything is stored as nodes or edges, both of which can be
labeled. Labels help in narrowing and simplifying the search process
through the database [@www-slideshare]. It is a highly scalable
software and can be distributed across multiple machines.  The graph
query language that accompanies the software has traversal framework
which makes it fast and powerful [@www-neo4j]. The Neo4J is often
used for clustering. It offers two feature clustering solutions:
Causal Clustering and Highly available
clustering [@www-neo4j-causal-cluster]. Casual clustering focuses
on safety, scalability and causal consistency in the
graph [@www-neo4j-HA-cluster]. The highly available cluster places
importance to fault tolerance as each instance in the cluster has full
copies of data in their local database.
