Apache Ranger [@www-apache-ranger] is open source software project
designed to provide centralized security services to various
components of Apache Hadoop. Apache Hadoop provides various mechanism
to store, process and access the data. Each Apache tool has its own
security mechanism. This increases administrative overhead and is also
error prone.  Apache Ranger fills this gap to provide a central
security and auditing mechanism for various Hadoop
components [@www-ranger-architecture]. Using Ranger, Hadoop
administrators can perform security administration tasks using a
central UI or Restful web services. He can define policies which
enable users/user-groups to perform specific action using Hadoop
components and tools. Ranger provides role based access control for
datasets on Hadoop at column and row level.  The blog
article [@www-ranger-key-features] explains that the row level
filtering and dynamic data masking are most important features of
Apache Ranger. Ranger also provides centralized auditing of user acces
and security related administrative actions.
