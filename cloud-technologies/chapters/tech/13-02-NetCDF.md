NetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing,
machine-indepen dent data formats that support the creation, access,
and sharing of array oriented scientific data. NetCDF was developed
and is maintained at Unidata, part of the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Commun ity Programs (UCP). Unidata is
funded primarily by the National Science Foundation
\cite{paper-netCDF} [@www-netcdf]. The purpose of the Netwo rk
Common Data Form (netCDF) interface is to support the creation,
efficient access, and sharing of data in a form that is
self-describing, portable, compact, extendible, and archivable Version
3 of netCDF is widely used in atmospheric and ocean sciences due to
its simplicity. NetCDF version 4 has been designed to address
limitations of netCDF version 3 while preserving useful forms of
compatibility with existing application software and data archives
\cite{paper-netCDF}.  NetCDF consists of: (a) A conceptual data model
(b) A set of binary data formats (c) A set of APIs for C/Fortran/Java
