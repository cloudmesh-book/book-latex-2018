Moab HPC Suite is a workload management and resource orchestration
platform that automates the scheduling, managing, monitoring, and
reporting of HPC workloads on massive scale. It uses multi-dimensional
policies and advanced future modeling to optimize workload start and
run times on diverse resources. It integrates and accelerates the
workloads management across independent clusters by adding
grid-optimized job submission. Moab's unique intelligent and
predictive capabilities evaluate the impact of future orchestration
decisions across diverse workload domains (HPC, HTC, Big Data, and
Cloud VMs)\cite{www-moab}.
