D3.js is a JavaScript library responsible for manipulating documents
based on data. D3 helps in making data more interactive using HTML,
SVG, and CSS. D3's emphasis on web standards makes it framework
independent utilizing the full capabilities of modern browsers,
combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach
to DOM manipulation [@www-d3].

followed by applying data-driven transformations to the document. It
is very fast, supports large datasets and dynamic behaviours involving
