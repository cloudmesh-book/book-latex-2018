vSphere was developed by VMware and is a cloud computing
virtualization platform. [@www-vmware] vSphere is not one piece of
software but a suite of tools that contains software such as vCenter,
ESXi, vSphere client and a number of other technologies.  ESXi server
is a type 1 hypervisor on a physical machine of which all virtual
machines are installed.  The vSphere client then allows administrators
to connect to the ESXi and manage the virtual machines.  The vCenter
server is a virtual machine that is also installed on the ESXi server
which is used in environments when multiple ESXi servers exist.
Similarly, vCloud is also a suite of applications but for establishing
an infrastructure for a private cloud. [@www-mustbegeek] The suite
includes the vsphere suite, but also contains site recovery management
for disaster recovery, site networking and security.  Additionally, a
management suite that can give a visual of the infrastructure to
determine where potential issues might arise.
