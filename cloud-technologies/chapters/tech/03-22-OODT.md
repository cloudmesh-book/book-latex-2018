The Apache Object Oriented Data Technology (OODT) is an open source
data management system framework. OODT was originally developed at
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to support capturing, processing and
sharing of data for NASA's scientific archives. OODT focuses on two
canonical use cases: Big Data processing and on Information
integration. It facilitates the integration of highly distributed and
heterogeneous data intensive systems enabling the integration of
different, distributed software systems, metadata and data. OODT is
written in the Java, and through its REST API used in other languages
including Python [@www-oodt2].
