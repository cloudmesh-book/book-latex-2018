It is a parallel computing platform and application programming
interface (API) model created by Nvidia. It allows software developers
to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit for general purpose
processing. The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct
access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational
elements, for the execution of compute kernels.  CUDA platform has
advantages such as scattered reads i.e the code can read from
arbitrary addresses in memory, unified virtual memory, unified memory,
faster downloads and readbacks to and from the GPU and full support
for integer and bitwise operations. [@www-cuda-wikipedia].  CUDA
is used for accelerated rendering of 3D graphics, accelerated
interconversion of video file formats, encryption, decryption and
compression of files.  It is also usedd for distributed calculations,
face recognition and distributed computing. [@www-cuda-wikipedia]
