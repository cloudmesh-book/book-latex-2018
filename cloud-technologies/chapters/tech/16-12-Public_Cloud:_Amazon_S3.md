Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage object which
provides a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any
amount of data from anywhere on the web [@www-amazon-s3]. With
Amazon S3, users can store as much data as they want and can scale it
up and down based on the requirements.For developers Amazon S3
provides full REST API's and SDK's which can be integrated with
third-party technologies. Amazon S3 is also deeply integrated with
other AWS services to make it easier to build solutions that use a
range of AWS services which include Amazon CloudFront, Amazon
CloudWatch, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon RDS, Amazon Glacier etc. Amazon S3
provides automatic encryption of data once the data is uploaded in the
cloud. Amazon S3 uses the concept of Buckets and Objects for storing
data wherein Buckets are used to store objects. Amazon S3 services can
be used using the Amazon Console
Management [@www-amazon-s3-docs]. The steps for using the Amazon
S3 are as follows: (1) Sign up for Amazon S3 (2) After sign up, create
a Bucket in your account, (3) Create and object which might be an file
or folder, and (4) Perform operations on the object which is stored in
the cloud.
