The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language
services development, combines a software stack with a code generation
engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between
C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C\#, Cocoa,
JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other
languages. [@paper-thrift] It includes a complete stack for
creating clients and servers. It includes a server infrastructure to
tie the protocols and transports together. There are blocking,
non-blocking, single and multithreaded servers available.  Thrift was
originally developed at Facebook, it was open sourced in April 2007
and entered the Apache Incubator in May, 2008. It became an Apache TLP
in October, 2010. [@www-thrift]
