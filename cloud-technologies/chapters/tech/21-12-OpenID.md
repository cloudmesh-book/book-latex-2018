OpenID is an authentication protocol that allows users to log in to
different websites, which are not related, using the same login
credentials for each, i.e. without having to create separate id and
password for all the websites. The login credentials used are of the
existing account. The password is known only to the identity provider
and nobody else which relieves the users' concern about identity being
known to an insecure website. [@ope1] It provides a mechanism that
makes the users control the information that can be shared among
multiple websites. OpenID is being adopted all over the web. Most of
the leading organizations including Microsoft, Facebook, Google,
etc. are accepting the OpenIDs [@ope2]. It is an open source and
not owned by anyone. Anyone can use OpenID or be an OpenID provider
and there is no need for an individual to be approved.
