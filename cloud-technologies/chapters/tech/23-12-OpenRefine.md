OpenRefine (formerly GoogleRefine) is an open source tool that is
dedicated to cleaning messy data. With the help of this user-friendly
tool you can explore huge data sets easily and quickly even if the
data is a little unstructured. It allows you to load data, understand
it, clean it up, reconcile it, and augment it with data coming from
the web [@www-openrefine]. It operates on rows of data which have
cells under columns, which is very similar to relational database
tables. One OpenRefine project is one table. The user can filter the
rows to display using facets that define filtering criteria. most
operations in OpenRefine are done on all visible rows: transformation
of all cells in all rows under one column, creation of a new column
based on existing column data, etc. All actions that were done on a
dataset are stored in a project and can be replayed on another
dataset. It has a huge community with lots of contributors meaning
that the software is constantly getting better and better.
