NaradaBrokering is a content distribution infrastructure for
voluminous data streams [@www-narada].  The substrate places no
limits on the size, rate and scope of the information encapsulated
within these streams or on the number of entities within the
system. The smallest unit of this substrate called as broker,
intelligently process and route messages, while working with multiple
underlying communication protocols. The major capabilities of
NaradaBrokering consists of providing a message oriented middleware
(MoM) which facilitates communications between entities (which
includes clients, resources, services and proxies thereto) through the
exchange of messages and providing a notification framework by
efficiently routing messages from the originators to only the
registered consumers of the message in
question [@paper-nb-sustrate]. Also, it provides salient stream
oriented features such as their Secure end-to-end delivery, Robust
disseminations, jitter reductions.

NaradaBrokering incorporates support for several communication
protocol such as TCP, UDP, Multicast, HTTP, SSL, IPSec and Parallel
TCP as well as supports enterprise messaging standards such as the
Java Message Service, and a slew of Web Service specifications such as
SOAP, WS-Eventing, WS-Reliable Messaging and
WS-Reliability [@www-narada-features].
