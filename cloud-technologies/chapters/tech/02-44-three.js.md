Three.js is an API library with about 650 contributions till date,
where users can create and display an animated 3D computer graphics in
a web browser. It is written in javascript and uses WebGL, HTML5 or
SVG. Users can animate HTML elements using CSS3 or even import models
from 3D modelling apps [@www-threejs-wiki]. In order to display
anything using three.js we need three basic features, which are scene,
camera and renderer. This will result in rendering the scene with a
camera. In addition to these three features, we can add animation,
lights (ambience,spot lights, shadows), objects (lines, ribbons,
particles), geometry etc [@www-threejs-webpage].
