Apache Flex [@www-flex] is an open source application framework
for building and maintaining mobile and web applications that deploy
consistently on multiple browsers, desktops and mobile devices. It was
initially developed by Macromedia and then acquired by Adobe
Systems. It was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation in
2011 [@blog-flex]. It can pull data from multiple back-end sources
such as Java, Spring, PHP, Ruby, .NET, Adobe ColdFusion, and SAP and
display it visually allowing users to drill down into the data for
deeper insight and even change the data and have it automatically
updated on the back end [@wiki-flex].
