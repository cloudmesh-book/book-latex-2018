Titan:db is a distributed graph database that can support of thousands
of concurrent users interacting with a single massive graph database
that is distributed over the clusters [@www-Titan]. It is open
source with liberal Apache 2 license. Its main components are storage
backend, search backend, and TinkerPop graph stack. Titan provides
support for various  storage backends and also linear scalability for
a growing data and user base. It inherits features such as 'Gremlin'
query language and 'Rexter' graph server from
TinkerPop [@www-TinkerPop].  For huge graphs, Titan uses a
component called Titan-hadoop which compiles Gremlin queries to Hadoop
MapReduce jobs and runs them on the clusters. Titan is basically
optimal for smaller graphs.
