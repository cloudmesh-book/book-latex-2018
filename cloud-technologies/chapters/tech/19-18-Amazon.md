Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a provider of Infrastructure as
a Service (IaaS) on cloud. It provides a broad set of infrastructure
services, such as computing, data storage, networking and databases.
One can leverage AWS services by creating an account with AWS and then
creating a virtual server, called as an instance, on the AWS cloud.
In this instance you can select the hard disk volume, number of CPUs
and other hardware configuration based on your application needs.  You
can also select operating system and other software required to run
your application. AWS lets you select from the countless services.
Some of them are mentioned below:

     -  Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2)
     -  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
     -  Amazon CloudFront
     -  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
     -  Amazon SimpleDB
     -  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
     -  Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
     -  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are the two core IaaS services, which are
used by cloud application solution developers
worldwide. [@www-aws]
