As explained in [@www-SAML], Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML) is a secured XML based communication mechanism for
communicating identities between organizations. The primary use case
of SAML is Internet SSO. It eliminates the need to maintain multiple
authentication credentials in multiple locations. This enhances
security by elimination opportunities for identity theft/Phishing. It
increases application access by eliminating barriers to usage. It
reduces administration time and cost by excluding the effort to
maintain duplicate credentials and helpdesk calls to reset forgotten
passwords. Three entities of SAML are the users, Identity Provider
(IdP-Organization that maintains a directory of users and an
authentication mechanism) and Service Provider (SP-Hosts the
application /service). User tries to access the application by
clicking on a link or through an URL on the internet. The Federated
identity software running in the IdP validates the user's identity and
the user is then authenticated. A specifically formatted message is
then communicated to the federated identity software running at SP. SP
creates a session for the user in the target application and allows
the user to get direct access once it receives the authorization
message from a known identity provider.
