Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, is an infrastructure management
tool, it has an open source platform as well as an enterprise version
and uses infrastructure as a code to increase operator
productivity. It's latest release is Terraform 0.8 According to the
website [@www-Terraform] it enables users to safely and
predictably create, change and improve the production infrastructure
and codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be
shared amongst other users and can be treated as a code, edited,
reviewed and versioned at the same time. The
book [@www-terraform-book] explains that it can manage the
existing and popular service it provides as well as create customized
in-house solutions. It builds an execution plan that describes what it
can do next after it reaches a desired state to accomplish the goal
state. It provides a declarative executive plan which is used for
creating applications and implementing the infrastructures. Terraform
is mainly used to manage cloud based and SaaS infrastructure, it also
supports Docker and VMWare vSphere.
