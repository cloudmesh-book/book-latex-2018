FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol [@www-ftp-wiki]. It
is network protocol standard used for transferring files between two
computer systems or between a client and a server. It is part of the
Application layer of the Internet Protocol Suite and works along with
HTTP/SSH. It follows a client-server model architecture. Secure
systems asks the client to authenticate themselves using a Username
and Password registered with the server to access the files via
FTP. The specification for FTP was first written by Abhay Bhushan in
1971 and is termed as RFC114 [@www-rfc114]. The current
specification, RFC959 in use was written in 1985. Several other
versions of the specification are available which provides firewall
friendly FTP access, additional security extensions, support for IPV6
and passive mode file access respectively. FTP can be used in command
line in most of the operating systems to transfer files. There are FTP
clients such as WinSCP, FileZilla etc. which provides a graphical user
interface to the clients to authenticate themselves (sign on) and
access the files from the server.
