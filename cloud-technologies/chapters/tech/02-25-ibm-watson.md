IBM Watson is a super computer built on cognitive technology that
processes information like the way human brain does by understanding
the data in a natural language as well as analyzing structured and
unstructured data [@www-ibmwatson-wiki].  It was initially
developed as a question and answer tool more specifically to answer
questions on the quiz show \textit{Jeopardy} but now it has been seen as
helping doctors and nurses in the treatment of cancer. It was
developed by IBM's DeepQA research team led by David Ferrucci. With
Watson you can create bots that can engage in conversation with
you [@www-ibmwatson]. You can even provide personalized
recommendations to Watson by understanding a user's personality, tone
and emotion. Watson uses the Apache Hadoop framework in order to
process the large volume of data needed to generate an answer by
creating in-memory datasets used at run-time. Watson's DeepQA UIMA
(Unstructured Information Management Architecture) annotators were
deployed as mappers in the Hadoop Map-Reduce framework. Watson is
written in multiple programming languages like Java, C++, Prolog and
it runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Today Watson is available
as a set of open source APIs and Software As a Service product as
well\cite{www-ibmwatson}.
