TensorFlow is a platform that provides a software library for
expressing and executing machine learning algorithms.vTensorFlow has a
flexible architecture allowing it to be executed with minimal change
to many heterogeneous systems such as CPUs and GPUs of mobile devices,
desktop machines, and serversc\cite{tensorflow-paper-2016}.
TensorFlow can ``express a wide variety of algorithms, including
training and inference algorithms for deep neural netowrk models, and
it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine
learning systems into production across more than a dozen
areas''. TensorFlow utilizes data flow graphs in which the ``nodes in
the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges
represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated
between them'' [@www-tensorflow].  TensorFlow was developed by the
Google Brain Team and has a reference implementation that was released
on 2015-11-09 under the Apache 2.0 open source license.
