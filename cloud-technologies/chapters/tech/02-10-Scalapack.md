ScaLAPACK is a library of high-performance linear algebra routines for
parallel distributed memory machines. It solves dense and banded
linear systems, least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and
singular value problems. It is designed for heterogeneous computing
and is portable on any computer that supports Message Passing
Interface or Parallel Virtual Machine [@www-scalapack].

ScaLAPACK is a open source software package and is available from
netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. It contains driver
routines for solving standard types of problems, computational
routines to perform a distinct computational task, and auxiliary
routines to perform a certain subtask or common low-level
computation. ScaLAPACK routines are based on block-partitioned
algorithms in order to minimize the frequency of data movement between
different levels of the memory hierarchy.
