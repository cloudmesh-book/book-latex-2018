Nimbus Infrastructure [@www-nimbus-wiki] is an open source IaaS
implementation. It allows deployment of self-configured virtual
clusters and it supports configuration of scheduling, networking
leases, and usage metering.

Nimbus Platform [@www-nimbus] provides an integrated set of tools
which enable users to launch large virtual clusters as well as launch
and monitor the cloud apps. It also includes service that provides
auto-scaling and high availability of resources deployed over multiple
IaaS cloud.  The Nimubs Platform tools are cloudinit.d, Phantom and
Context Broker.  In this paper [@nimbus-paper], the use of Nimbus
Phantom to deploy auto-scaling solution across multiple NSF FutureGrid
clouds is explained. In this implementation Phantom was responsible
for deploying instances across multiple clouds and monitoring those
instance.  Nimbus platform supports Nimbus, Open Stack, Amazon and
several other clouds.
