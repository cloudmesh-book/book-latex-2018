Azure Blob storage is a service that stores unstructured data in the
cloud as objects/blobs. Blob storage can store any type of text or
binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer
Blob storage is also referred to as object storage. The word 'Blob'
expands to Binary Large OBject [@www-azure-3]. There are three
types of blobs in the service offe- red by Windows Azure namely block,
append and page blobs [@www-azure-2].  1. Block blobs are
collection of individual blocks with unique block ID.  The block blobs
allow the users to upload large amount of data.  2. Append blobs are
optimized blocks that helps in making the operations efficient.
3. Page blobs are compilation of pages. They allow random read and
write operations. While creating a blob, if the type is not specified
they are set to block type by default. All the blobs must be inside a
container in your storage.  Azure Blob storage is a service for
storing large amounts of unstructured object data, such as text or
binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP
or HTTPS. You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the
world, or to store application data privately. Common uses of Blob
storage include serving images or documents directly to a browser,
storing files for distributed access, streaming video and audio,
storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving
and storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted
service.  Azure Storage is massively scalable and elastic with an
auto-partitioning system that automatically load-balances your
data. Blob storage is a specialized storage account for storing your
unstructured data as blobs (objects) in Azure Storage. Blob storage is
similar to existing general-purpose storage accounts and shares all
the great durability, availability, scalability, and performance
features. Blob storage has two types of access tiers that can be
specified, hot access tier, which will be accessed more frequently,
and a cool access tier, which will be less frequently accessed. There
are many reasons why you should consider using BLOB storage. Perhaps
you want to share files with clients, or off-load some of the static
content from your web servers to reduce the load on
them [@www-azure-3].
