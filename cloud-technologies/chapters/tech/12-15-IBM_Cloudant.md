Cloudant is based on both Apache-backed CouchDB project and the open
source BigCouch project. IBM Cloudant is an open source
non-relational, distributed database service as service (DBaaS) that
provides integrated data management, search and analytics engine
designed for web applications. Cloudant's distributed service is used
the same way as standalone CouchDB, with the added advantage of data
being redundantly distributed over multiple
machines [@www-ibm-cloudant].
