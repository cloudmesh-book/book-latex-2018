GraphX is Apache Spark's API for graph and graph-parallel
computation [@www-graphX].
    
GraphX provides:
    
    Flexibility: It seamlessly works with both graphs and
    collections. GraphX unifies ETL, exploratory analysis, and
    iterative graph computation within a single system. You can view
    the same data as both graphs and collections, transform and join
    graphs with RDDs efficiently, and write custom iterative graph
    algorithms using the Pregel API.
    
    Speed: Its performance is comparable to the fastest specialized
    graph processing systems while retaining Apache Spark's
    flexibility, fault tolerance, and ease of use.
    
    Algorithms: GraphX comes with a variety of algorithms such as
    PageRank, Connected Components, Label propagations, SVD++,
    Strongly connected components and Triangle Count.

    It combines the advantages of both data-parallel and
    graph-parallel systems by efficiently expressing graph computation
    within the Spark data-parallel framework [@www-graphX1].

    It gets developed as a part of Apache Spark project. It thus gets
    tested and updated with each Spark release.
