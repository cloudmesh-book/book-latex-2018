Apache Giraph is an iterative graph processing system built for big
data [@www-giraph-apache]. It utilizes Hadoop Mapreduce technology
for processing graphs [@www-apache-giraph-wiki].  Giraph was
initially developed by Yahoo based on the paper published by Google on
Pregel [@www-apache-giraph-pcworld].  Facebook with some
improvements on Giraph could analyze real world graphs up to a scale
of a trillion.Giraph can directly interface with HDFS and Hive (As
it's developed in Java) [@www-apache-giraph-fb].
