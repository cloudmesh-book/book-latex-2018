H20
===

``H20 is a open source platform that can execute highly advanced and
complex machine learning algorithms in faster and scalable
way,regardless of the size, format and location of the
data'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o]. ``It achieves this by serializing the data
faster between nodes and clusters that stores huge amount of data. Data
processing is done in memory thus providing faster
response'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o]. ``It uses fine grain parallelism
technique for processing of distributed data archiving 100x faster speed
as compared to traditional mapreduce without compromising on
accuracy'' [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o]. H2O4GPU, Sparking Water and
driverless AI are popular products of H2O. Many companies across
different domain such as banks, insurance, online sales are using H2O
platform for their machine learning and AI related research.
