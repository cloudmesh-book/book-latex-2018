\section{Physics Case Study}\label{physics-case-study}

This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and
evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson.
The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman
diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is
devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson
production with various forms of shape of signal and various background
and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple
principles of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they
are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces
Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in
natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random
Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial
and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

\subsubsection{Looking for Higgs Particle and Counting
Introduction}\label{looking-for-higgs-particle-and-counting-introduction}

We return to particle case with slides used in introduction and stress
that particles often manifested as bumps in histograms and those bumps
need to be large enough to stand out from background in a statistically
significant fashion.

\video{Physics}{13:49}{Discovery of Higgs Particle}{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaypHlgFyuU}

We give a few details on one LHC experiment ATLAS. Experimental physics
papers have a staggering number of authors and quite big budgets.
Feynman diagrams describe processes in a fundamental fashion.

\subsubsection{Physics Use Case II 1: Class
Software}\label{physics-use-case-ii-1-class-software}

We discuss how this unit uses Java and Python on both a backend server
(FutureGrid) or a local client. WE point out useful book on Python for
data analysis. This builds on technology training in Section 3.

\video{Physics}{9:30}{Higgs Particle Events and Counting}{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8j2qB4lSZ0}

This video contains Java information, but we are no longer using Java in
this class.

\subsubsection{Physics Use Case II 2: Event
Counting}\label{physics-use-case-ii-2-event-counting}

We define `'event counting'' data collection environments. We discuss
the python and Java code to generate events according to a particular
scenario (the important idea of Monte Carlo data). Here a sloping
background plus either a Higgs particle generated similarly to LHC
observation or one observed with better resolution (smaller measurement
error).

Background}\label{physics-use-case-ii-3-with-python-examples-of-signal-plus-background}

This uses Monte Carlo data both to generate data like the experimental
observations and explore effect of changing amount of data and changing
measurement resolution for Higgs.

This lesson continues the examination of Monte Carlo data looking at
effect of change in number of Higgs particles produced and in change in
shape of background.

whats going on with a plot of expected Higgs production experimental
cross sections (probabilities) for signal and background.
