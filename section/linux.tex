\FILENAME

we point to, but could be a worth while read for someone that has no
experience in Shell programming:

best. We will however summarize in table form a number of useful
commands that you may als find in a link to a RefCard.

\section{.bashrc and .bash\_profile}\label{bashrc-and-.bash_profile}

Usage of a particular command and all the attributes associated with it,
use `man' command. Avoid using `rm -r' command to delete files
recursively. A good way to avoid accidental deletion is to include the
following in your .bash\_profile file:

\begin{verbatim}
alias e=open_emacs
alias rm='rm -i'
alias mv='mv -i' 
alias h='history'
\end{verbatim}
