\section{Python Click}

Click allows developers to create composable command line interfaces. It
aims to simplify the the process of writing command line tools.
Highlights include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  arbitrary nesting of commands
\item
  automatic help page generation
\item
  supports of lazy loading of subcommands at runtime
\end{itemize}

The following example take from the clik Web page at

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \url{http://click.pocoo.org/}
\end{itemize}

illustrates the use of click

\begin{lstlisting}
import click

@click.command()
@click.option('--count', 
              default=1, 
              help='Number of greetings.')
@click.option('--name', 
              prompt='Your name',
              help='The person to greet.')
def hello(count, name):
    """Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times."""
    for x in range(count):
    click.echo('Hello %s!' % name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()
\end{lstlisting}

A sample invocation looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ python hello.py --count=3
Your name: Gregor
Hello Gregor!
Hello Gregor!
Hello Gregor!
\end{lstlisting}

To obtain the man page you can say:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ python hello.py --help
Usage: hello.py [OPTIONS]

    Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times.

    Options:
        --count INTEGER  Number of greetings.
        --name TEXT      The person to greet.
        --help           Show this message and exit.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Install}

\begin{lstlisting}
pip install click
pip install click-shell
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Click Shell}

click-shell is an extension allowing to run click commands in a shell

\begin{lstlisting}
from click_shell import shell

@shell(prompt='my-shell > ', intro='Starting the shell ...')
def my_shell():
    pass

@my_shell.command()
def the_command():
    print ('the shell is running')

...
\end{lstlisting}
