\subsection{Install}

\begin{lstlisting}
pip install apache-libcloud
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Disadvantage}

Some advanced cloud features do not work.

\subsection{Quick example}

\begin{lstlisting}
from pprint import pprint

import libcloud

cls = libcloud.get_driver(libcloud.DriverType.COMPUTE,
                          libcloud.DriverType.COMPUTE.OPENSTACK)

driver = cls('username', 'api key')

pprint(driver.list_sizes())
pprint(driver.list_nodes())
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Compute}

https://libcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/index.html\#terminology

Compute

Node - represents a cloud or virtual server. NodeSize - represents node
hardware configuration. Usually this is amount of the available RAM,
bandwidth, CPU speed and disk size. Most of the drivers also expose an
hourly price (in dollars) for the Node of this size. NodeImage -
represents an operating system image. NodeLocation - represents a
physical location where a server can be. NodeState - represents a node
state. Standard states are: running, rebooting, terminated, pending,
stopped, suspended, paused, erro, unknown.

Security

KeyPair - represents an SSH key pair object.

Block Storage

StorageVolume - represents a block storage volume VolumeSnapshot -
represents a point in time snapshot of a StorageVolume

\subsection{Pricing}

https://libcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/pricing.html

out of date

Currently only way to update pricing is programmatically using
libcloud.pricing.download\_pricing\_file() function. By default this
function retrieves the latest pricing file from our git repository and
saves it to \textasciitilde{}/.libcloud.pricing.json

Custom pricing

Exercise: write prising fetcher with beautiful soap
