\chapter{Overview}

\FILENAME


\section{Cloud Computing}

The course covers all aspects of the cloud architecture stack, from Software as
a Service (large-scale biology and graphics applications), Platform as a
Service (MapReduce (Hadoop), Iterative MapReduce (Twister) and NoSQL (HBase)),
to Infrastructure as a Service (low-level virtualization technologies).



\section{Class Summary}

In this course you will learn basic concepts in Cloud Computing, including how
to write your own software using key cloud programming models and tools to
support data mining and data analysis applications.

\section{Course Organization}

This course is powered by Latex and ReStructuredText but is conducted in a
more structured fashion with a mix of recorded lectures, programming labs and
forum discussions. Each week we will post on Canvas the instructions as to
work to be done. Note all grading and forum discussion will use Canvas and
Piazza.

\section{What Should I Know?}

Cloud Computing online is a programming intensive course. It has similar
requirements to the CS graduate level residential version. Students are
expected to have weekly (or biweekly) programming homework. General programming
experience with Windows or Linux using Java (2-3 years) and scripts is
required. A background in parallel and cluster computing is a plus, although
not necessary.

\section{What Will I Learn?}

At the end of this course, you will have learned key concepts in cloud
computing and enough programming to be able to solve data analysis problems on
your own.

\section{Class Projects}

The class has several projects that will allow students to get firsthand
experience with the technologies taught here. Projects are performed on
VirtualBox Appliances or academic clouds like FutureGrid.

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Lesson Order}

Lessons in this course will be uploaded on a weekly basis. The difficulty of
the topics covered in these online lectures is demonstrated by way of a color
coding system. 'Green' is basic, 'Yellow' is intermediate, and 'Red' is
advanced. We will build up to more difficult concepts as the class progresses.

\section{Course Projects}

Take part in online assignments that will teach you the course material in
hands-on examples. You will apply actual code designed to calculate website
page ranking, word count, and even build your own search engine. More than a
dry tutorial, this is your chance to find out how some of the most widely used
applications on the Internet work on a fundamental level.

\section{Course Developer}
Dr. Judy Qiu is an Associate Professor in the School of Informatics and
Computing at Indiana University. Her research interests focus on data-intensive
computing at the intersection of cloud and multicore technologies, with an
emphasis on life science applications using MapReduce as well as traditional
parallel and distributed computing approaches.
