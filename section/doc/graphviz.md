## Usage

To use graphvis creadte a dot and run the following command.

	dot -Tpng filename.dot -o filename.png

This will create a png file. Other formats are also possible such as svg, or PDF 


	dot -Tsvg filename.dot -o filename.svg
	dot -TPDF filename.dot -o filename.pdf

For inclsion in latex documents we recommend you create PDF output as it has a much better quality and is maller in size than png.
