\subsection{Usage}

To use graphvis creadte a dot and run the following command.

\begin{lstlisting}
dot -Tpng filename.dot -o filename.png
\end{lstlisting}

This will create a png file. Other formats are also possible such as
svg, or PDF

\begin{lstlisting}
dot -Tsvg filename.dot -o filename.svg
dot -TPDF filename.dot -o filename.pdf
\end{lstlisting}

For inclsion in latex documents we recommend you create PDF output as it
has a much better quality and is maller in size than png.
