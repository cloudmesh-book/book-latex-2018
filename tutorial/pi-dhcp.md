We describe how to set up **D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration
**P**rotocol (DHCP) server on a Raspberry Pi Cluster by hand. 
The OS on these Pi's is RASPBIAN STRETCH WITH DESKTOP released on 2017-11-29.

## Introduction

``The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) enables any of the
computers on the local area network (LAN) to be given a network
configuration automatically as soon as the boot process on the machine
gets underway'' \cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-pidhcp-pdf}. Instead of
using a router, we use one of the raspbery PI's to fulfill this
function.  The other Pi's are configured in such a way that the serve
as clients and obtain the network address form our raspberry providing
the addresses. They are DHCP Clients, and to use DHCP they need to
have their networking setup properly configured.

Hence, we set up one of the five Pi's in the cluster (hostname: red00)
to be the DHCP server, and the rest four with Pi's with the names
red01, red02, red03, red04 will then be DHCP clients.

The information which is passed from DHCP Server to its clients
includes\cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-pidhcp-pdf}:

* a suitable IP Address;
* the address of your router;
* an address of one or more Domain Name Servers (DNS)

## Setting up the DHCP server

Choose one of the Pi's as the DHCP server, using the Pi with hostname
*red00* as an example here.  Log into this Pi and open a terminal. The
following steps are all processed in the terminal of this chosen Pi.

### Software installation

The first step is to install a package dhcpd, which is a popular DHCP
server for the Pi. In the terminal
    
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
        
At the end of the installation process, the DHCP server daemon will be
started and it will **fail**, because the configuration has not been
done. It will get fixed in later steps.

### Configure the DHCP server

The configuration file for the DHCP server is at
*/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf* Start the editing process with *nano* as
follows:

    sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
        
Define subnet which will be the network that all the other Pi's will
connect to. Add the following lines to the file
*/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf*:

    subnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.2.100 192.168.2.200;
        option broadcast-address 192.168.2.255;
        option routers 192.168.2.1;
        max-lease-time 7200;
        option domain-name "red00";
        option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;
    }

Note: The subnet and netmask are IP values required for assisting
communications across your LAN.

* `subnet`: ``you can obtain the IP Address of a computer on your LAN using the Linux ifconfig
command: take the *Inet Addr* value and replace its final octet with a zero to get your subnet'' \cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-pidhcp-pdf};

* `range`: this is the range of IP Addresses distributed by this DHCP Service. You may have two ranges such as 
        
      range 192.168.2.100 192.168.2.120
      range 192.168.2.150 192.168.2.200

  to refrain the DHCP server from handling out some of the addresses
  (from 121 to 149)
    
* `domain-name-server`: If you have a DNS service for machines on your
LAN, enter the server IP address or you can use public DNS Services
such as Google's, which are at `8.8.8.8`. and
 `8.8.4.4`.

Finally, Save your changes to the file with `Ctrl-O` and exit nano
with `Ctrl-X`.

### Change the interface of DHCP service 

Now you need to tell the DHCP service the interface to hand out
addresses on. Edit the following file:
        
    sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
        
Find the following section:
    
    # On what interfaces should the DHCP server (dhcpd) serve DHCP requests?
    #       Separate multiple interfaces with spaces, e.g. "eth0 eth1".
    INTERFACES=""
        
And change the last line to:
    
    INTERFACES="eth0"

### Set static IP Address for the server

The next step is to set a static IP address on the Raspberry pi as
this won't be able to start the DHCP service without it. We use *nano*
to edit the file at */etc/network/interfaces*:

    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
        
Add the following lines:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.2.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
            
If you have a line like: 

    iface eth0 inet dhcp
        
be sure to disable this line. It is used to set up the Pi as a DHCP
client, however, we want this Pi to be a DHCP server.

Now this Raspberry Pi will now always have the IP address
`192.168.2.1`. You can double-check this by entering the command
`ifconfig`; the IP address should be shown on the second line just
after `inet addr`.
 
### Restart the DCHP service

Finally, to complete the set-up, restart the DHCP service by the
following command:
        
    sudo service isc-dhcp-server stop
    sudo service isc-dhcp-server start
        
### Checking the currently leased addresses

Run the following command to check the currently assigned addresses: 

    cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
        
You should expect something like the following:

    lease 192.168.2.102 {
      starts 0 2018/02/25 21:36:16;
      ends 0 2018/02/25 21:46:16;
      tstp 0 2018/02/25 21:46:16;
      cltt 0 2018/02/25 21:36:16;
      binding state active;
      next binding state free;
      rewind binding state free;
      hardware ethernet b8:27:eb:42:c9:e9;
      uid "\001\270'\353B\311\351";
      set vendor-class-identifier = "dhcpcd-6.11.5:Linux-4.9.59-v7+:armv7l:BCM2835";
      client-hostname "red01";
    }
    lease 192.168.2.100 {
      starts 0 2018/02/25 21:41:09;
      ends 0 2018/02/25 21:51:09;
      tstp 0 2018/02/25 21:51:09;
      cltt 0 2018/02/25 21:41:09;
      binding state active;
      next binding state free;
      rewind binding state free;
      hardware ethernet b8:27:eb:60:b8:8e;
      uid "\001\270'\353`\270\216";
      set vendor-class-identifier = "dhcpcd-6.11.5:Linux-4.9.59-v7+:armv7l:BCM2835";
      client-hostname "red03";
    }
    lease 192.168.2.101 {
      starts 0 2018/02/25 21:41:10;
      ends 0 2018/02/25 21:51:10;
      tstp 0 2018/02/25 21:51:10;
      cltt 0 2018/02/25 21:41:10;
      binding state active;
      next binding state free;
      rewind binding state free;
      hardware ethernet b8:27:eb:9a:55:13;
      uid "\001\270'\353\232U\023";
      set vendor-class-identifier = "dhcpcd-6.11.5:Linux-4.9.59-v7+:armv7l:BCM2835";
      client-hostname "red02";
    }
    lease 192.168.2.103 {
      starts 0 2018/02/25 21:41:11;
      ends 0 2018/02/25 21:51:11;
      tstp 0 2018/02/25 21:51:11;
      cltt 0 2018/02/25 21:41:11;
      binding state active;
      next binding state free;
      rewind binding state free;
      hardware ethernet b8:27:eb:3a:7c:7c;
      uid "\001\270'\353:||";
      set vendor-class-identifier = "dhcpcd-6.11.5:Linux-4.9.59-v7+:armv7l:BCM2835";
      client-hostname "red04";
    }

Note that in this case, the 4 Pi's with hostnames: red01, red02,
red03, and red04 are assigned IP
addresses `192.168.2.102`, `192.168.2.101`, `192.168.2.100`
and `192.168.2.103` respectively

An alternative way is to use the following command:

        dhcp-lease-list --lease PATH_TO_LEASE_FILE
        
which would give a cleaner look such as:

    Reading leases from /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
    MAC                IP            hostname valid until manufacturer
    ===================================================================
    b8:27:eb:3a:7c:7c  192.168.2.103 red04    2018-02-25 21:56:13 -NA-
    b8:27:eb:42:c9:e9  192.168.2.102 red01    2018-02-25 21:50:30 -NA-
    b8:27:eb:60:b8:8e  192.168.2.100 red03    2018-02-25 21:56:11 -NA-
    b8:27:eb:9a:55:13  192.168.2.101 red02    2018-02-25 21:56:12 -NA-
        
## Configure fixed IP's for clients

It is sometimes needed to have the dhcp server assign fixed addresses
to each node in the cluster so that it is easy to remember the node by
IP addresses. For instance next node in the cluster is red01 and it
would be helpful to have a fixed IP for example `192.168.2.50`.
 
To do this, we modify the */etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf* by:
           
    sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
           
 and add the following lines:
 
     host red01 {
        hardware ethernet b8:27:eb:42:c9:e9;
        fixed-address 192.168.2.50;
    }
 
 Notice that `b8:27:eb:42:c9:e9` is the so-called MAC Address of the
 Ethernet interface (network adapter) of the machine which you wish to
 name red01. ``It provides a hardware reference on the client for the
 server to use in network communications.You can find the MAC
 Address(es) of the Ethernet interface(s) on any computer using the
 *ifconfig* command'' \cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-pidhcp-pdf}. You may
 also notice that the previous two commands of checking the currently
 leased addresses will also provide MAC Addresses.
 
**Warning**: ``if you wish to have your DHCP Server award a fixed IP
Address it should be one outside the DHCP normally assigned range of
IP Addresses'' \cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-pidhcp-pdf}.

Another thing to notice is that the previous two commands of checking
the currently leased addresses does not include the clients given a
fixed address. For example, if one runs the command after the fixed IP
config for red01:

    dhcp-lease-list --lease PATH_TO_LEASE_FILE
        
the result would be:

    Reading leases from /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
    MAC                IP            hostname valid until manufacturer
    ===================================================================
    b8:27:eb:3a:7c:7c  192.168.2.103 red04    2018-02-25 21:56:13 -NA-
    b8:27:eb:60:b8:8e  192.168.2.100 red03    2018-02-25 21:56:11 -NA-
    b8:27:eb:9a:55:13  192.168.2.101 red02    2018-02-25 21:56:12 -NA-
        
red01 is no longer in the list because it is assigned a fixed-address
`192.168.2.50`

### Checking the currently leased addresses for fixed IP clients

To check the currently leased addresses for fixed IP clients:
        
        cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.eth0.leases
